Susan Ashlock gets special mention, as she has given me endless support
 with love, great patience, and myriad wonderful trips into the mountains
 over the latter half of this work.
 I can't wait to explore the world with her now that this thesis is complete.
 Furthermore, this measurement's approaches of source-code management, continuou
s analysis builds, and unit testing were inspired by looking over her software-e

 Without her professional influence, this blind measurement would not have
 been possible.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Four fundamental interactions are known to Physics.
 In historical order of characterization, they are gravity, which governs
 planetary motions; electromagnetism, which describes the interactions of
 electrically charged objects, and the weak force and strong forces, which
 govern nuclear and subnuclear dynamics.
 The electric and weak forces were unified theoretically by Glashow, Salam,
 and Weinberg as the electroweak interaction in 1967 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "GSWNobelPrize"

\end_inset

.
 The strong force is described well by quantum chromodynamics.
 The resulting theory of the electroweak and the strong, precisely tested,
 finely tuned, and quantum in nature, is known as the Standard Model.
 Einstein's theory of gravity, general relativity, is consistent with all
 precision tests, but it contains no known links to the Standard Model.
 For interactions with sufficiently high energy density, one or both theories
 must fail, as they predict different phenomena.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Standard Model is a triumph.
 It is a complex theory, with 18 or more parameters (particle masses, coupling
 constants, and mixing parameters) which are tuned to fit observation.
 The Standard Model had one major remaining prediction - the existence of
 the `Higgs boson', a lynchpin for the theory, which was discovered by the
 LHC in 2012 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Aad20121,Chatrchyan201230"

\end_inset

.
 After tuning, the Model has predictive power, correctly recovering within
 experimental and theoretical error the known zoo of observed particles,
 resonances, and phenomena, with very few exceptions.
 The exceptions are, therefore, very important.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Observations which the Standard Model cannot explain:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Gravity: There is no tree-level coupling between uncharged objects in the
 Standard Model.
 Furthermore, on a charge for charge basis, the interactions in the Standard
 Model are 
\begin_inset Formula $>10^{40}$
\end_inset

 times stronger than gravity, perhaps hiding signatures of a unifying theory.
 The theory of gravity, General Relativity, is well-tested and in agreement
 with experiment

Neutrino mass, oscillation: The Standard Model admits only massless left-handed
 neutrinos, yet they are observed to have a small but very significant,
 mass.
 Furthermore, the mass and flavor eigenstates of the neutrino are not the
 same.
 These effects were easily accommodated by adding the neutrino mixing angles
 to the list of tuning parameters, but it was not anticipated by anything

Newton proposed the gravitational inverse square law in 1687 in order to
 explain the motions of celestial bodies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 He suggested that the gravitational force between two objects is always
 attractive, is proportional to the mass of each object, and inversely proportio
nal to the square of the distance between them.
 This model was remarkably good at predicting the motion of celestial orbits,
 the tides, and gave the first quantitative estimate for the mass of the
 Earth.

The inverse square law (ISL) for gravity has been subjected to many experimental
 and astronomical tests.
 The observed stability of elliptical orbits and the apparent validity of
 Kepler's laws gave immediate support to the theory at solar-system scales.

 in 1798

Theories
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we present the leading theoretical motivations for testing the inverse
 square law at short distance.
 There are many more proposed theories which are not covered here.
 In general, the theoretical guidance to experimentalists is clear: measurements
 at shorter ranges and with higher sensitivity are valuable.
 Particular emphasis is placed on shrinking the shortest range at which
 experiments can see Newtonian gravity itself.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As experimentalists, we take particular joy in testing theories like the
 `fat-graviton' theory described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, which prescribes both longest and shortest distances over which we must
 test, making it completely-falsifiable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
String Theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
String theory provided the catalyst for a resurgence of interest in the
 inverse square law at sub-millimeter scales in the late 1990s.
 At the cost of as many as seven extra dimensions, the theory offers a promise
 of unifying gravity with the other forces.
 The extra dimensions are hidden away from normal observation with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compactification
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, introducing a length-scale below which extra dimensions are relevant to
 particle interactions and above which any effects of extra dimensions are
 suppressed.
 Critically, the effects of gravity would be sensitive to the change in
 dimensionality by obeying Gauss' Law at all scales - diluting gravity into
 the many extra dimensions at short distances, while diluting into only
 three spatial dimensions at longer scales.
 This motivates the comparatively low strength of gravity in the three-dimension
al macroscopic world.
 This scenario predicts that gravity is significantly more attractive at
 scales shorter than the compactification scale.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If parametrized as a particle-exchange theory, string theory predicts two
 new types of exchange particles, known as the dilaton and the radion.
 Both would appear gravitationally as Yukawa violations of the inverse square
 law at scales comparable to the compactification length.
 The dilaton is responsible for the familiar Gauss' law increase in strength
 of gravity, while the radion is associated with excitations of the periodic
 spacetime normally accorded to the compactified dimensions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, the compactification scales can be as small as the Planck scale,

 It was shown in 1998 by Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali that, using

 As self-interaction is a general property of fields, the notion is very
 reasonable.
 In its simplest form as a scalar field, a chameleon interaction must be
 constrained by limiting not only the exchange particle's mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 but also the self interaction strength 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 Because chameleon interactions are self-screening, the screening length

becomes the relevant length scale at which the new interaction may emerge
 from camouflage.
 The possibility of self-interaction-based screening opens up considerable
 theoretical freedom for new theories of dark energy and dark matter in
 the face of existing experimental constraints.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chameleon interactions are ready-made to evade traditional inverse square
 law tests.
 All precision tests of short-range gravity at gravitational strength to
 date, including our experiment, place a metal foil between the source and
 detector masses to suppress non-gravitational interactions.
 Because of the self-screening within materials the foil significantly diminishe
s the apparent strength of any chameleon interaction.
 When searching for chameleons, isolating shields must be made as thin and
 of as low density a material as possible, or dispensed with entirely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of the self-interacting nature of chameleons, existing theoretical
 methods have limited regions of parameter space over which the effects
 of chameleons can be reliably predicted.
 The remaining calculable region is now severely constrained, and current-genera

 Unparticle interactions could appear in tests of short range gravity

 The generic signature of a new unparticle interaction is an additional
 power-law-potential fifth force; it does not alter the gravitational potential
 to be 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{G}\propto1/r^{1+\epsilon}$
\end_inset

, but rather 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{G}\propto(1/r+C(R_{G}/r)^{2d_{I}-1})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is a dimensionless constant (weakly dependent on 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{u}$

 The existing body of inverse square law tests place tight constraints on
 these interactions.
 Indeed, the first publication on unparticles appeared in March 2007, and
 these constraints, from other theorists, were in place by August.
 The tight constraints on new theory that stem from precision tests of gravity
 are the guaranteed payoff that come with incremental improvement in the

Principle - Gauss' Law Test
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is easily shown that, in three dimensions, any force that obeys a 
\begin_inset Formula $1/r$
\end_inset

 potential satisfies Gauss' law 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-Gm\oiint_{S}\frac{\vec{r}}{|r|^{3}}\cdot d\hat{r}=-4\pi Gm.
\]

\end_inset

 The converse is true, too: If a force law satisfies Gauss' Law, then the
 field flux through a sphere centered on a point charge must be constant
 for all sphere radii.
 As the surface area of a three-dimensional sphere in three spatial dimensions
 is proportional to the square of its radius, then the field strength must
 fall as 
\begin_inset Formula $1/r^{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our experiment is a test of the uniformity of the gravitational field of
 an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

 sheet of mass.
 It is in this sense that our experiment is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Gauss' law test of gravity.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 For any force in three spatial dimensions, the field from an infinite uniform
 two-dimensional sheet of charge must, by symmetry, be perpendicular to
 the plane of the sheet.
 Furthermore, if the interaction obeys Gauss' law, the flux of field remains
 constant with increasing distance from the sheet.
 Therefore, the strength of the interaction cannot vary with distance.
 This fact immediately suggests a simple test for whether an interaction
 follows Gauss' Law: Measure the force acting upon a test charge at two
 different distances from a sheet of charge.
 If the two measured forces are not equal, then the interaction does not
 obey Gauss' Law.
 Such an experiment is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

null-test
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for any deviation from an inverse square law.
 Colloquially, it might be referred to as a

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In idealized form, our experiment compares the gravitational field strength
 at two distances from an infinite sheet of mass.
 Finite sheet masses are suspended on opposite arms of a torsion pendulum.
 The sheet masses are aligned parallel to their moment arms, but displaced
 in opposite directions perpendicular to the arms (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Simple Parallel plate cartoon"

\end_inset

).
 If there is an inverse-square-law violating force between the sheets on
 the pendulum and an infinite sheet of matter, the pendulum will feel a
 torque.
 If the distance between the pendulum and the infinite sheet is modulated,
 the torque will vary in sync with the modulation.
 If there are no inverse-square law-violating interactions between the pendulum
 and sheet, the pendulum will experience 
\emph on
no torque change
\emph default
 as the infinite sheet is translated.
 The difficulties in the measurement primarily involve ensuring that the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

infinite sheet
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 approximation is valid, that the mechanism moving the sheet adds negligible
 gravitational interaction, and that gravity (and any new interaction) is
 the only messenger between the sheet and the pendulum.

Great attention was paid to systematic effects.
 As any foil motion could lead to a parasitic signal, a Fizeau fiber interferome
ter was built to monitor the foil position.
 We believe that this is the first inverse-square-law measurement to have
 a dedicated foil monitor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For the primary goal of constraining Yukawa-like violations of the inverse
 square law, the data analysis makes a conservative choice to treat all
 systematic effects as Yukawa interactions, with independent interaction
 strengths and associated lengthscales.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
While the measurement was begun before blinding, the experimental analysis
 has been performed blind.
 Early in the process of developing the analysis, the true experimental
 results were accidentally viewed twice.
 So many critical parts of the data analysis have changed since that time
 that, at the time of unblinding, we have no idea what the outcome will
 be.
 While the experiment cannot be regarded as truly blind, it has brought
 our blind-measurement experience up from nothing and directly leads the
 way to a future measurement.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In order to facilitate the unblinding of this complex analysis, and to guarantee
 reproducibility, the entire analysis and the creation of this document
 are entirely automated.
 A collection of free software, the source-code repository, and the experimental
 data are all that are required to re-generate this result.
 The majority of the numerical quantities stated in this document are automatica
lly either extracted from the configuration files used to initialize the
 data analysis or are products of the analysis itself.
 These quantities are either stated in accordance with standard protocol
 for significant digits or with their associated uncertainties.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Throughout, we use torque units of fN-m, as the signals we seek are at that
 order.
 The smallest signal of interest is approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim0.1$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

fN-m.
 This leads to the rare automated statement of a torque like 
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand input
filename "../extracted/translationTorqueFit.tex"

\end_inset

, where the point is that the signal is large and resolved, not that the
 uncertainty should be taken seriously beyond the leading two digits.
 These few oddities occur only where approximate statements are appropriate.
 Our software libraries properly handle such quantities correctly in scientific
 notation, but would lose the reader's visceral connection to the natural
 scale of 
\begin_inset Formula $1$

 Handling these corner-cases correctly would add significant complexity,
 and thus opportunity for error, to our software.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Foil-stretcher design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The design of the mechanism for stretching foils is important.
 The foil must be flat and tightly stretched.
 More recently, it has become clear that the foil surface must be easy to
 access and clean.
 In the past, our group has constructed foils by clamping beryllium-copper
 foils between strong aluminum rings while the entire assembly was submerged
 in liquid nitrogen.
 Upon warming to room temperature, the differential expansion of the aluminum
 rings brought the foil to high uniform tension.
 This arrangement offers superior rigidity, but the clamping rings do not
 provide sufficient access to the foil face.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The PlateWash foil stretcher is designed to provide good access to the front
 face of the foil and excellent flatness.
 It is constructed much as one would make a bongo drum; a clamping ring
 holds the foil at its perimeter, and a rounded-edge inner 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pusher
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that pushes on the back of the foil to bring it up to tension.
 Key to the success of this design is the rounded edge of the inner pusher.
 The radius of the edge must be large compared to the foil thickness in
 order to completely determine the state of the foil at the position of
 last contact.
 The radius of the edge should continue well past the point of last contact,
 to ensure a smooth transition, without any burrs or varying radial position
 of last contact.
 Furthermore, after turning, sanding, and polishing on the lathe, the pusher
 should be gently lapped, just for a moment, on a granite inspection plate
 to make the final planarization of the point of last contact.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to enable excellent access to the foil face, but preserve uniform
 tension in the foil, it is essential that the front ring of the foil clamping
 ring be very thin.
 In the case of PlateWash, with parallel fiber/foil alignment, the fiber
 is separated by only a millimeter from the foil face.
 The front clamping ring is only 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim1.2$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

mm thick.
 This allows the foil to remain nearly flat when being tensioned, requiring
 minimum slack in the foil to permit the foil pusher to come into tension
 while permitting full access to the foil face.
 In this iteration of the experiment, the front ring does not retreat behind
 the foil face, requiring a slight deflection of the fiber screw and inclination
 of the apparatus in order to clear the torsion fiber.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dimensions of the entire instrument are partially-set by the availability
 of thin foils.
 We were unable to find strong metal foils of thickness 
\begin_inset Formula $<12$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\mu$

m in widths larger than 4 inches.
 This constrains the inner bore of the foil stretcher, hence the size of
 the attractor, and therefore size of the pendulum.

 Light reflected from the pendulum passed back through the collimating lens
 and was focused, via a mirror, onto a two-dimensional position-sensitive
 photodiode.
 The detector (UDT SC-10D

 The autocollimator noise gave a sensitivity of 
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand input

\end_inset

, plotted in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Autocollimator noise"

\end_inset

.
 The four photodiode signal currents were measured by transimpedance pre-amplifi
ers adjacent to the photodiode in vacuum.
 We refer to the sensor as a `pseudo-autocollimator', as the traditional
 beamsplitter of a true autocollimator was replaced by a pair of 45-degree
 mirrors placed astride the objective lens optical axis.
 This arrangement preserves 2-4 times as much light intensity at the price
 of introducing a weak sensitivity to translation of the pendulum mirror
 along the optical axis; it remains unclear whether this was an advantageous
 trade.
 The added translation sensitivity was not burdensome, as excellent entire-instr
ument performance was easy to reach at large pendulum-foil separations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tip and twist of the pendulum were computed in software.
 As in an analog readout, the angles were determined by taking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Diff/Sum
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 -- for each axis the difference between the left and right (up and down)
 channels was computed and divided by their sum.
 This standard procedure minimizes the autocollimator's sensitivity to light
 intensity variations.
 Doing the computations in software allowed more-precise levelling of the
 twist axis signal than can be readily achieved in hardware, as any synthetic
 combination of the tip and twist angles can be trivially generated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, the autocollimator was operated with a software lock-in technique.
 The laser drive current was modulated at 500
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Hz, creating an approximately square-wave signal at the photodiode.
 The photodiode signal was digitized at 25
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

kHz.
 In each cycle of the laser drive current, 25 samples were recorded with
 the laser on, and 25 samples with the laser off.
 By taking the difference, we suppress the influence of any photodiode dark
 current.
 By averaging the locked-in signal, interference at frequencies incommensurate
 with the lock-in frequency is suppressed.

 Two planar electrodes were placed in close proximity (

 The electrodes were housed within grounded `guard electrodes' to control
 the effects of stray fields.
 As the pendulum was electrically grounded, the application of a voltage
 to an electrode attracts the pendulum in the same way that the plates of
 a charged capacitor attract one another.

 electrode, with DC feedback voltage variation of less than 20% over the

).
 Running on one electrode, by imposing a small

 introduced by any offset voltages or contact potential differences that

 From a practical standpoint, however, having two electrodes makes recovery
 from extreme transients (earthquakes, attractor-foil collisions) more expedient.

 The turbo pump was backed by a small rotary oil roughing pump; our initial

The motion control system has one non-standard property for a precision
 translation stage: it is pneumatically actuated.
 In aggregate, getting this system to work well required months of effort.
 It was worth every day for its systematic-rejection power (see Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 for further motivation) .
 The pneumatic actuation system has zero electrical components within the
 vacuum envelope.
 While the attractor flexure system was designed to accommodate standard
 micrometer actuators, if needed, the actuator is a phosphor-bronze bellows.
 The bellows is fed by a thin copper tube connected to a pressure-regulation
 positioned outside the vacuum chamber.
 When the system is taking science data, the position encoder for the flexure
 is a precision absolute pressure gauge outside the apparatus.
 The advantage to this arrangement is apparent when considering systematic
 uncertainties; by closing a valve between the apparatus and the pressure
 regulation/measurement system, it is possible to control for 
\bar under
all
\bar default
 attractor-correlated systematic effects that could be introduced by the
 data acquisition, sensing, and control systems.
 This valve isolates systematic uncertainties to only those directly correlated
 with the physical motion of the attractor or with changes in gas pressure
 downstream of the isolating valve.

 The

 is the equivalent of a lock on a pair of calipers; whatever air is present
 in the bellows when the valve is closed is trapped there, and the pressure/posi
tion is still measured continuously by the gauge.
 If there are no leaks and the absolute temperature (K) does not change,
 then the attractor can be held fixed in any position.
 As an additional capability, it was useful for foil-interferometer calibration
 to have a controlled and very slow leak in the attractor drive system;
 the manual valves make this possible.

\begin_layout Standard
The gas-handling system was originally designed without the

, but it became critical to our success.
 We had intended to operate with the pulse-width modulation valve operating
 in continuous PID feedback to pressure or position sensors, this would
 have enabled fast position changes and excellent control over the attractor's
 position.
 Alas, the pulse-width modulation was still measurable and unacceptably
 large at the attractor -- attractor motion during measurement phases opens
 whole classes of systematic effects we do not wish to consider.
 The modulator could not be switched at higher frequencies, and any further
 passive low-pass filters would compromise the speed of our attractor motion.
 So, we fell back to open loop control of the modulator duty cycle and the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

, which isolates the modulator accumulator from the bellows at times when
 pressure change is not desired.
 In this application, the bi-directional isolation of the fuel injector

 in the attractor position system comes from the pulse-width modulation
 system itself.
 The modulation valve and the locking valve are not coordinated at timescales
 comparable to the modulation frequency, so the locking valve shuts off
 in different parts of the modulation every time.
 Therefore, the attractor stops in a slightly different location on every
 move.
 This dominates the position scatter in attractor position for each

On longer timescales, the fluctuation of atmospheric pressure is important.
 The precision regulator that feeds the gas handling system is referenced
 to atmospheric pressure.
 The attractor flexure, on the other hand, moves according to the pressure
 relative to vacuum.
 As the gas-handling system is nothing but a fancy pressure division device,
 the open-loop duty-cycle control of the modulation rides along the carrier
 of atmospheric pressure.
 This effect can be seen in Figure

 This effect limited how close we could reliably operate the attractor to
 the foil over long periods of time with a simple control strategy; if the

\begin_layout Standard
In order for the intensity values measured at the photodiode to be meaningful,
 we must develop an intensity-change to displacement conversion.
 As the intensity at the output port varies sinusoidally with foil position,
 the sensitivity of the instrument is spatially-varying.
 With the initial visible-light laser, we attempted to lock the fringe phase
 into the location of maximum sensitivity by varying the laser temperature
 temperature, and hence frequency.
 With the infrared distributed-feedback laser, the temperature coefficient
 is so small that such an approach cannot work.
 Future versions of the experiment may include positioning feedback for
 the fiber mount in order to maximize sensitivity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Determining fringe contrast can be done by displacing the foil.
 The attractor can be pressed into the foil by lightly over-driving the
 translation stage.
 If valves are manipulated to permit a slow retreat of the attractor (or
 using the very slow leak of the isolation valve), a fringe pattern may
 be obtained, as in Figure

As it is challenging to infer anything about an interferometer's signal
 near a fringe minimum or maximum, we don't.
 We only consider times when the interferometer was in the middle 71% (
\begin_inset Formula $\sin(\pi/4)=\sqrt{2}/2=0.707$
\end_inset

) of the range of fringe contrast, i.e.
 the range over which the interferometer output is approximately linear.
 Over that range, the slope of the fringe-to-displacement sinusoid varies
 by at most 21% from the mean (average slope 
\begin_inset Formula $2\sqrt{2}/\pi$
\end_inset

, maximum 1, minimum 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}/2$
\end_inset

 As we are only interested in an estimate (and hopefully an upper bound)
 on the foil's contribution to pendulum torque, this is sufficient.
\end_layout

Within this range, we use an approximation for the sinusoid's slope, if

At sub-Hz frequencies, noise in the interferometer is believed to be polarizatio

 the entire Bloch sphere 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 As the light emitted from the laser is, in general, polarized, the beamsplitter
 is likely to be polarization-sensitive, and the cavity and detector may
 have some polarization sensitivity, any change in polarization throughout
 the fibers may yield changing results.
 The effect of simply jostling the fiber is easily noted in the readout
 of the apparatus; listening to the photodiode output with headphones yields
 a siren-like tone, giving extra credence to the polarization-rotation explanati
on of the noise.
 Securing the fiber, where possible, to immovable objects with tape yielded
 a substantial improvement in sub-Hz noise.

With the introduction of the foil-positioning motors (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

), it was necessary to allow control of the interferometer tip position
 from outside the vacuum vessel.
 The interferometer tip was connected to a long flexure lever with a linear
 reduction ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim10$
\end_inset

:1, shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

.
 Before pumping down, the fiber tip was translated far from the foil.
 After the foil and attractor were aligned, then the fiber tip was slowly
 brought toward the foil until fringes were observed.
 This must be done with care; going too far will puncture the foil with
 the fiber tip.
 The motorized approach is easier, faster, allows better fringe contrast,
 and damages fewer foils than aligning by hand.

 for foil motion.

Great caution was exercised in the design of the data acquisition system.
 In order to prevent any correlation of attractor-related information with
 the pendulum readout, the attractor control was placed on an entirely separate
 computer.
 The computers shared only one ground, starred out from the main grounding
 block (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 While the interferometer readout could have been done by the pendulum control
 computer, it was convenient to use a third computer, with its own data-acquisit
ion board.
 The data were acquired from these three machines in parallel, each with
 their own clock.
 The timing system was arranged to synchronize all three computer clocks

 for synchronization.

 Careful attention was paid to the signal grounds.
 When not used in fully-differential mode, the card allows the use of two

 One ground was referenced to the photodiode readout, and the second to
 the grounding block.
 The attractor and interferometer DAQ systems used NI-6211 USB DAQ cards.

 The vacuum pumping system was electrically isolated by a ceramic vacuum
 break above the turbo pump.
 In-vacuum electrical components which required a floating ground were floated
 and had signal grounds attached outside the apparatus.
 Control of the pendulum feedback electrodes was done using battery-powered
 instrumentation amplifiers placed just outside the apparatus in order to
 simplify grounding to a comprehensible few-component arrangement.
 The connection from the pneumatic drive to the experiment passed through
 a short section of plastic tubing.
 The foil interferometer readout is, beautifully, entirely optical; the
 nearest associated electronic components were more than a meter from the
 apparatus.

For the thermal tests, our group's custom wireless XBee sensor readout systems

 Microscopically, there is only one form of gas damping - collisions between
 gas particles and an oscillator allow momentum and energy exchange.
 Experimentally, when the particle mean free path is larger than the dimensions
 of the chamber, gas damping appears in two forms: `free' damping and `proximity

 Free gas damping is independent of an oscillator's location in a vacuum
 chamber, and depends only upon properties of the gas and the dimensions

 Once the pendulum-foil separation is small compared to the characteristic
 size of any metallic patches, we expect this effect to be important.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Estimating or measuring the size of this effect is a challenge.
 Our pendulums may be more sensitive to this effect than available Kelvin
 probes.
 It is difficult to compare with surface-physics experiments due to differing
 surface preparation and vacuum properties, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experimentally, all of our group's short-range experiments have seen increased
 noise at small separations.
 The patch effect is one of the stories invoked to explain it.
 Improved noise performance is seen from newly-coated foils immediately
 after pump-down in both PlateWash and our other short-range experiment,
 but we don't have a satisfactory nor quantitative understanding of this
 effect.

 Numerous connections in series between, for example, the pendulum and foil,
 give rise to a small (

 For this experiment, fluctuations in contact potential are indistinguishable
 from noise from a

\end_inset

, except, perhaps, through the distance-dependence of the noise.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The influence of any contact-potential noise, either through direct fluctuation
 or through swing-coupling can be minimized by nulling the contact potential.
 The force acting between plates of a parallel-plate capacitor with area
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, plate separation 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, and potential difference 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $|F|=\epsilon_{0}A\frac{V_{0}^{2}}{d^{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 For small variations in voltage (
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}\rightarrow V_{0}+\delta v)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $|F|=\epsilon_{0}\frac{A}{d^{2}}(V_{0}^{2}+2V_{0}\delta V+(\delta V)^{2})$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, nulling 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 can minimize the effect of any voltage fluctuation.
 Similarly, for swing, where 
\begin_inset Formula $d\rightarrow d_{0}+\delta d$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $|F|=\epsilon_{0}\frac{AV_{0}^{2}}{(d_{0}+\delta d)^{2}}$
\end_inset

, so the swing coupling is quadratically suppressed by minimizing 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 We carefully designed battery-powered isolated and remotely-operable power
 supplies to permit the nulling of 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

, and demonstrated control of 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 at better than the 100 mV level.
 Swing parallel to the foil, which we expect to have approximately equal
 amplitude, should cause much smaller variations in electrostatic torques
 acting on the pendulum, as only the effective lever-arm of the pendulum
 may be altered.
 If the contact potential varies across the foil plane, parallel-swing torques
 will come primarily from that variation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, the presence of an uncompensated contact potential acts as
 an anti-spring for the pendulum, pulling the torsion pendulum asymptotically
 away from its zero position.
 As the pendulum twists away from a parallel orientation with respect to
 the foil, the 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}^{2}/d^{2}$
\end_inset

 nature of the capacitive force pulls even harder.
 Once the capacitive torque is greater than the torsion fiber restoring
 torque, the pendulum runs away toward the foil.
 As our sensitivity to new physics increases exponentially with smaller
 pendulum/foil separation, we are driven to operate the pendulum at the
 smallest distance at which we can preserve stable operation of the pendulum.
 Compensation of the contact potential allows us to operate with lower noise
 at closer distances.

 the duration of the experiment -- the pendulum and foil were directly electrica
lly connected.
 While we cannot measure the contact potential, past experience suggests
 that it is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim0.2-1$

 Minimizing the size of this potential is the single most effective change

 Because of the pendulum's 
\begin_inset Formula $1/f^{2}$

 response function at high frequency, angle readout noise is the primary
 limit on the instruments' torque sensitivity at high frequency.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Environment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A number of environmental factors can give rise to extra noise in the balance.
 Careful design and construction helps to limit these effects.
 Many of them are transient in nature, and may be avoided by focusing data
 acquisition into quiet parts of the day, week, and year.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Ground motion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several ways in which ground motion can cause an apparent pendulum
 torque:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Rotation of the ground: This rotates the instrument relative to the pendulum
 and appears as a spurious torque.
 In practice, this effect is much smaller than other noise sources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
`Tilt feedthrough': Asymmetry in the fiber cross-section converts the tilt
 of the fiber support into a pendulum twist.
 This is suppressed, but not eliminated, by the fiber `prehanger'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Magnetic damper asymmetry: If the field of the swing damper is inhomogeneous,
 and the prehanger mass has a magnetic moment or is insufficienty-centered,
 damper swing will be converted to a torque.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Vertical bouncing: up-down motion of the pendulum changes the tensile stress
 in the fiber.
 There is a connection between tensile fiber stress and equilibrium position,
 so vertical shaking may give rise to apparent torques.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Electrostatic interaction with nearby surfaces: For PlateWash, and most
 short-range experiments, this is the dominant effect.
 Asymmetric position-dependent pendulum interactions with the foil, control
 electrodes, and nearby grounded surfaces easily create powerful torques
 on the pendulum.
 Careful minimization of contact potentials is essential to reduce tilt/swing
 couplings.

Seismic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Earthquakes worldwide can affect the balance.
 Quakes of magnitude 3+ in the immediate region (Northern California to
 Alaska) can disturb operation for minutes to hours.
 Large quakes, such as the 2010 Chilean and 2013 Japanese quakes, disturb
 Earth so violently that it can take a day or more before aftershocks and
 low-frequency modes of terrestrial vibration have damped.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PlateWash also sees less-palpable seismic effects, such as the `microseismic
 peak', an ever-present seismic signature of ocean waves striking the continenta
l coastline, and the effects of nearby humanity (traffic and laboratory
 noise).

Tilt
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effects of tilt are almost indistinguishable from other ground motion
 in PlateWash.
 Qualititatively, we expect ground rotation to be our dominant source of
 external noise at sub-mHz frequencies.
 As an example, on sunny days, we see a marked change in torque at sunrise
 when sunlight and its associated heating reaches the hillside in which
 our laboratory is embedded.
 Tilt is also the experiment's strongest coupling to human activity.
 Walking up to the apparatus deforms the floor, leading somehow through
 the instrument to a tilt coupling and an associated torque.
 When initially characterizing the apparatus, we determined that this effect
 was not gravitational in origin by suspending a 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim40$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

kg lead mass from our laboratory crane: lifting the mass only a millimeter
 off the floor was sufficient to produce an instrument response comparable
 to that seen from body weight.
 Lifting it higher had negligible effect.
 As with many of our external sources of noise, tilt noise in the lab is
 least at night, giving us a daily 6-8

The majority of Eöt-Wash pendulums are designed to have vanishing low-order

While the coupling mechanism to wind is related to some combination of seismic
 effects, tilt, changing gravitational gradients, or pressure, we aren't

 What is clear from our data is a strong coupling between outside wind and
 pendulum noise.
 Stormy periods can elevate torque noise by as much as an order of magnitude
 in comparison with still periods.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As elucidated above, the electrostatic environment near the pendulum is
 important to these vibrational noise sources.
 The largest and closest surface to the pendulum is the foil.
 Minimizing the pendulum-foil contact potential, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{PF}$
\end_inset

, can have considerable impact on pendulum noise.
 Because of a non-constant contact potential as a function of pendulum angle,
 we were unable to trim 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{PF}$
\end_inset

 as well as should be possible in principle.
 Furthermore, as seen in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "sec:Capacitor-Systematic"

\end_inset

, we chose to give up control of 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{PF}$
\end_inset

 in order to eliminate a possible systematic effect.
 With further investigation, the systematic was traced to a bypass capacitor.
 Direct grounding of the foil is no longer required, and we will re-enable

 Future pendulum designs and future iterations of this experiment must minimize

Temperature

\begin_layout Standard
The PlateWash apparatus is sensitive to temperature.
 The fiber's equilibrium position and drift rate are perhaps most temperature
 dependent, but there are many temperature sensitive elements in the apparatus.
 To limit the effects of temperature variation, the instrument is located
 in a temperature controlled room.
 The room temperature varies by less than 1 degree through the year and
 <0.2 degrees daily.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As passive isolation, the vacuum system is an excellent insulator, with
 a time constant of days for the internal aluminum baseplate with respect
 to the outside world.
 As further, rather limited, insulation, the clean-room fans are turned
 off during measurement periods, trapping a volume of air around the apparatus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Instrumental noise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many electronic effects can create excess noise.
 Most pick-up effects are indistinguishable from autocollimator noise.
 Because PlateWash normally operates in electrostatic feedback, there is
 a second channel through which EMF pickup, ground loops, and finite digital-to-
analog conversion noise can couple to the pendulum.
 These effects were assessed by comparing the pendulum noise with and without
 the feedback electrodes grounded.
 No excess noise was seen.

Systematics

Systematic uncertainties are the primary challenge of this measurement.
 Ensuring that no gravitational signals are mimicked nor masked demands

 us astray.
 Approximate quantitative estimates are given where calculable.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Electronic Crosstalk
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any effect that is not directly related to attractor motion, but is aware
 of attractor position, lands in this catch-all category.
 In general, these systematics are very important in many experiments.
 In this case, the experiment includes an isolation valve on the air pressure
 line to the attractor bellows.
 The valve is positioned downstream of the electronic pressure gauge.
 The valve may be closed, and 
\bar under
every
\bar default
 electrical signal associated with the operation of the experiment is unchanged.
 The data analysis system is also unchanged, making it possible to test
 for these systematics directly.
 This ability is the greatest strength of the pneumatic drive system; any
 electrically-actuated drive cannot separate electrical crosstalk in this
 way.

Dust
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any dust between the attractor and foil will cause the foil to move once
 the attractor-foil separation is smaller than the dust's characteristic
 size (Pendulum-foil dust is assessed via the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bounce test
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 Effort has been made to keep the active surfaces dust-free through the
 use of clean room procedures.
 We see the effects of dust in perhaps 50% of our initial cleanings of a
 surface.
 The presence of dust is inferred with the interferometer; if dust is present
 between the attractor and foil, it can cause a weak displacement of the
 foil before the attractor touches the foil directly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Attractor-foil contact potential
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The attractor and foil will, in general, have different values of electrical
 potential.
 The electrical connections between them will include a collection of Galvanic-p
otential generating junctions.
 The voltages generated at each junction are, as in a thermocouple, temperature-
dependent and may depend upon the detailed structure of the junction, leading
 to temperature sensitivity, temperature-gradient sensitivity, changes with
 mechanical creep, and perhaps microphonic pickup.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be safe from the effects attractor-correlated contact potential variation,
 the pendulum/foil contact potential cannot change by more than 1-10 nV
 in an attractor-correlated way.
 This voltage is hard to measure in any way but with a torsion balance,
 as the effective output impedance of any contact-potential generating phenomeno
n will be large (cannot drive much current), and the input impedance of
 the torsion balance as a voltmeter is very small (with the LISA test apparatus,
 we measured T
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 resistances of a quartz fiber).
 In defense of the experiment, no part of the moving attractor assembly
 is in contact with the pendulum or foil support structures.
 If an effect were to appear, it would most-probably be generated by somehow
 displacing the wires that connect the foil and pendulum to ground, or by
 shifting the

From the interferometer, we can see that the attractor, at the end of its

 The attractor must also have its own seismically driven vibrational modes.
 It is possible to place limits on the appearance of both kinds of modes
 using the foil interferometer; the raw data needed to do so were collected,

Small non-uniformities in density of the attractor or pendulum materials
 can mimic or mask a signal.
 The flat plate geometry of the experiment renders this effect largely second
 order.
 In the absence of an attractor non-uniformity, a pendulum void should be
 expected to have no effect at all.
 In the absence of a pendulum non-uniformity, an attractor void will cause
 a lateral position-dependent torque.
 If the attractor void were to occur near the outer corner of the dense
 pendulum inlay (worst case), the unmodulated torque would be
\begin_inset Formula $<10^{-24}$

\begin_inset space ~

 smaller.
 An attractor void sufficient to cause an unexpected torque would be easily

Horizontal displacement of the pendulum is an excellent potential test for

Tilt/apparatus deformation

Coupling to tilt is a general affliction of torsion balances.
 Perhaps because of the non-circular cross-section of fine torsion fibers,
 all balances exhibit 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tilt feedthrough
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In short range interaction experiments, the tilt feedthrough is exacerbated
 by the importance of spatially varying electrostatic potentials.
 The apparatus has a two-axis tilt sensor, but it was intentionally turned
 off during data-taking to eliminate any possible electromagnetic interference.
 The pendulum autocollimator is sensitive along both vertical and horizontal
 axes, and provides a continuous measurement of pendulum tilt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Nonlinear tilt feedthrough
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The apparatus may have attractor-related tilt for a number of reasons, including
 the displacement of the center of mass of the attractor assembly, deformations
 of the attractor mount, and changing geometry of the attractor air line.
 The flexure was mounted from its center in order to minimize any deformation
 of the apparatus as a whole.
 The deflection is expected to be both small and linear, limiting the impact
 on the measurement; we do not anticipate that non-linear tilt feedthrough,
 particularly nonlinearities that should have anything to do with attractor-foil
 proximity, will be a major concern.
 It is a challenge to study this effect experimentally, as the response
 to small injected tilts will be quite linear, and the response to large
 injected tilts may be inapplicable.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Flexure non-linearity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One interesting systematic effect that can exhibit considerable nonlinearity
 is the nonlinearity of the flexure itself.
 Most tilt-related effects are essentially blind to the attractor-foil distance.
 In order to maximise our use of the flexure's limited (
\begin_inset Formula $<2$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

mm) travel, the flexure's internal travel limit was located not far from
 the point at which the attractor pressed hard into the foil.
 If the double-compensating mechanism of the flexure experiences nonlinear
 stress near the (artificially-placed with mechanical stops) end of its
 travel, nonlinear stresses might be communicated to the baseplate.
 We designed the flexure-holding fixture to suspend the flexure from near
 its center, minimizing the opportunity for unexpected stresses to affect
 the rest of the apparatus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The changing effective length of the cantilevered attractor assembly will

 The attractor assembly weighs less than half a kilogram and displaces by
 less than a millimeter over the entire range of travel.
 In any realistic scenario we've considered, the 
\emph on
linear
\emph default
 component of the pendulum's tilt-driven horizontal displacement should
 be smaller than the nanometer-scale signal we see in the foil interferometer.
 Any residual nonlinear variation should be much smaller.

Magnetism

\begin_layout Standard
Magnetic systematics are among the most difficult to assess in these experiments.
 The foil provides limited, if any, shielding against low frequency magnetic
 fields.
 Because of the considerable strength of the magnetic interaction, great
 care must be taken to ensure that magnetic effects do not mimic or mask
 a gravitational signal.
 For the shortest-range effects, the torsion balance may be the most sensitive
 probe for their existence, complicating things considerably.
 Short range gravity research is becoming increasingly sophisticated in
 this realm; previous tests have only considered some of these effects.

Pneumatic Drive Leak 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the pneumatic drive system has a leak into the vacuum chamber, it would
 change the residual gas atmosphere in an attractor-correlated way.
 While the ion vacuum gauge was turned off during the experiment to preserve
 low-noise performance, we can get an indirect estimate of any potential
 leak using the attractor-leakback data (Figure

).
 The 2.5

cm diameter bellows leaked back at 2

nm/s, most-probably through small leaks in the locking valves.
 The internal pressure in the bellows was 1-2 atmospheres, so the maximum
 pressure rise from an attractor leak into the approximately cubic-meter
 vacuum chamber was 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim1\times10^{-9}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~

Torr/s, which should be compared with the base pressure of more than

 A variation of this size is well below the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim10\%$

 While it is not impossible for a 1% pressure variation to couple to the

N-m), the indirect path from bellows/gas system to the pendulum and the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have no way of varying the bellows pressure without moving the attractor,
 so experimental limits are hard to come by.
 Displacing the pendulum farther from the foil could reduce any squeeze-film
 related effects, but it would simultaneously change many other systematic
 couplings, making the test inconclusive.

 Furthermore, a compelling argument due to Eric Adelberger is one of wavelength.
 The lowest (most-penetrating) modes that participate in any Casimir interaction
 will have wavelengths typical of the gap between the plates and shorter.
 As even millimeter wavelength radiation has frequencies higher than 300
 GHz, it's unlikely to substantially penetrate a material that becomes impenetra

\begin_layout Chapter
Metrology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Understanding the separation between attractor and test masses is essential
 to any inverse square law test.
 However, because of our experiment's nearly-null parallel-plate geometry,
 the implications of a sufficiently-small error in metrology affect only
 the stated exclusion limits, but not the presence nor absence of an ISL
 violation.
 This is an important contrast to non-null experiments, where an error in
 attractor/sensor separation alone can lead to a Newtonian-gravitationally
 faked or masked signal for new physics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For PlateWash, metrology is relatively straightforward.
 We must ascertain the extent to which the pendulum and attractor are parallel
 and obtain an estimate of their relative separation.
 As in most inverse-square law tests, this is confounded by the isolating
 foil stretched between them.
 As the foil is quite flat (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Isolating-Foil"

\end_inset

), we break the problem in half, measuring the attractor-foil separation
 and the pendulum-foil separation.

Initial Alignment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment was initially aligned using the autocollimator.
 The attractor was fixed in place against two registry blocks and firmly
 clamped.
 The autocollimator was then centered on the attractor and aligned such
 that the light returned to near the center of the sensor.
 The up-down and left-right angles were recorded.
 The attractor was then translated through its full range of motion, and
 the position on the autocollimator recorded, see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Flexure-runout"

\end_inset

.
 The attractor was adjusted to a point 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim20$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m from the desired working position.
 The foil and attractor were cleaned with dry nitrogen and with clean room
 wipes/isopropanol.
 The foil was then placed in front of the attractor and iteratively aligned
 to the attractor using a combination of the autocollimator readout and
 a measurement of the attractor-foil capacitance.
 Gross alignment was done by hand.
 Fine adjustment was done using the Belleville washers on the foil mount.
 When optical alignment reached

\begin_layout Subsection
Cleaning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the attractor and foil were aligned, it was essential to guarantee
 the absence of debris/dust in the gap between them.
 To characterize the amount of dust in the gap, and to verify alignment,
 the attractor-foil capacitance was measured as a function of attractor
 position, including positions where the attractor touched the foil.
 Touching was, at this time, determined by noting the position where the
 capacitance reading became unreliable.
 The maximum capacitance recorded without signs of touching gave a proxy
 for the minimum attractor-foil separation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The attractor assembly was removed and the attractor face cleaned with isopropan
ol, clean room wipes, and dry nitrogen.
 The same was done with the attractor side of the foil.
 Both attractor and foil were visually inspected for dust.
 The attractor assembly was replaced against the registry blocks and re-clamped.
 The attractor-foil capacitance was measured as a function of attractor
 position.
 The cleaning procedure was repeated until no gains in capacitance were
 observed with subsequent cleanings.
 Typical maximum capacitances were 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim2$

nF; because these measurements were carried out at atmospheric pressure,
 they should not be used to determine the distance of minimum approach.

\begin_layout Subsection
Online Alignment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The critical distances between and relative orientations of the pendulum,
 foil, and attractor were determined with the bell jar closed, under vacuum,
 and after bake-out.
 Once the system's atmosphere was evacuated, both the pendulum's and foil's
 motion were essentially unaffected by gas-related effects.
 The foil-alignment motors (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Isolating-Foil"

\end_inset

) were then adjusted to maximize the highest measurable capacitance-before-short
ing between the attractor and foil.
 The pendulum's tip angle relative to the foil (about a horizontal axis
 parallel to the plane of the foil) was minimized by imaging through the
 bell-jar window and the

A number of other methods were explored, but the method of choice was as
 follows: The freely twisting pendulum was allowed to tap the foil as the
 attractor was pressed into the foil by the flexure stage.
 As the attractor displaced the foil, the angular amplitude of the tapping
 signal necessarily decreased to zero.
 The point where this occurred was used as a reference to determine the
 absolute distance between the pendulum and the attractor

We used several methods to assess the parallelism of the attractor and foil.
 When aligning the apparatus, we tipped the apparatus, placing the pendulum
 onto the foil, pressed the attractor into the back of the foil, and used
 the autocollimator-measured angular displacement of the pendulum as a proxy
 for parallelism.
 That got us close; the fine alignment was performed capacitively, tipping
 the foil slightly until a maximal capacitance could be measured without
 electrically shorting the attractor and foil together.
 With that complete, we performed the science experiment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Concerns regarding the difficulty of calculating fringing fields led us
 to view the capacitance measurement with skepticism.
 In January 2015, the untouched apparatus was brought back to life.
 The attractor and interferometer computers were turned on, and the interferomet
er laser and SRS SR720 capacitance meter were reinstalled.
 Unlike normal science operation, where the encoder can inject systematic
 interference, it was possible to connect and turn on the attractor optical
 encoder.
 The attractor bellows was pressurized to push the attractor into the foil
 by tens of microns, and allowed to leak slowly back over several hours,
 producing a smooth slow displacement over time.
 The results are shown in Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Subsection
Attractor-Foil touching
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the attractor-foil parallelism, we must know the absolute
 distance between the attractor and foil.
 This is determined through observing the attractor-displacement position
 where the attractor and foil touch.
 This is essential both for metrology and to provide a sharp cutoff against
 any foil-motion related systematic effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The determination of the touching point is done using the science data from
 the interferometer and attractor position on a per-measurement level, rather

The most-challenging metrology was on the pendulum side of the foil.

 The attractor's location was fixed, so the pendulum's horizontal (Section

) and vertical (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 of the foil.
 After the foil was installed and aligned, both the pendulum position (Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to visual access to the pendulum's separation from the foil,
 we installed a mirror that allows us to compare the horizontal (left/right)
 position of the torsion fiber to a ruled grating on the foil-stretcher.
 When the experiment is initially aligned, the fiber is centered on the
 top of the attractor, where 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 is denoted as farthest from the plane of the optical bench.
 The pendulum is translated attractor-axially away from the attractor, and
 the foil is installed.
 After the foil is fully aligned, but the fiber has not yet been translated
 horizontally, the pendulum is again brought near the foil, and the location
 of the fiber on the foil-stretcher's ruled grating is photographed via
 the viewport and the dedicated mirror.
 Once this is complete, then any horizontal translation of the fiber can
 easily be compared with this reference position in order to determine the
 horizontal position of the pendulum with respect to the top of the attractor.

The reference photo and in-position photo for this measurement are shown
 in Figure

 This entire set of measurements was done with a substantial horizontal
 position offset; the pendulum had been displaced horizontally in runs prior
 to the beginning of the science data in an effort to understand a systematic
 ISL-violating signal that would later be traced to the bypass capacitors
 (Section

 As can be seen in Section

Pendulum bounce-test.
 The pendulum swings freely in angle (vertical axis) as the pendulum support
 is translated slowly toward and away from the foil (horizontal axis).
 The bands reflect the assigned uncertainty; the slope of the band is determined
 only by the pendulum width and the distance translated.

The PlateWash apparatus permits visual access to the pendulum at all times
 through a glass vacuum viewport.
 Visual access provides a reliable and robust cross-check for our more-quantitat
ive metrology techniques.
 With the addition a mirror, we are able to see both (left and right) sides
 of the pendulum and photograph them.
 Using the known thickness of the pendulum, we can compare photographs of
 the pendulum taken during data-taking with photographs taken when the pendulum
 is pressed lightly against a flat surface (attractor or foil) to determine
 the data-taking pendulum's distance from, and angle with respect to, the
 foil.
 For the photos used in this determination, see Figure

For each photograph, the thickness of the pendulum, the pendulum reflection,
 and the gap between them were measured at repeatable points near the top,
 middle, and bottom of the pendulum.
 The widths of the gaps, divided by two to correct for reflection, were
 calibrated by the known pendulum thicknesses.
 The mean difference in gap size between the pre/post-science photographs
 and the inclined/on-foil photographs was computed to generate an estimate
 of the pendulum's displacement from the foil of

 Comparing the angle at which the experimental data were taken with the
 angle where the inferred lines cross in Figure

), we can use the pendulum photos to extract the effective angle at which
 the pendulum sits.
 The pendulum-thickness-calibrated difference between pre/post-science and
 inclined/on-foil photographs for each view of the pendulum was computed.
 The ratio of the two measured pendulum-foil separations to the pendulum
 width yields a pendulum twist angle of

We expect the pendulum tip angle to be a stable quantity, determined primarily

 We measured the absolute tip angle in two ways: the

The

Plateau Test

 is a quantitative method for determining the angle where the pendulum's
 surface closest to the foil is parallel to the foil, but is susceptible
 to systematic error due to pendulum curvature and dust.
 The entire apparatus is tipped to a significant angle (at least tens of
 milliradians) about the horizontal axis perpendicular to the attractor
 symmetry axis.
 Then, the pendulum displaced toward and away from the foil while the autocollim
ator reading (both up-down and left-right) is recorded.
 The angle at which the pendulum sits parallel to the foil appears as a
 plateau in the plot of measured angle as a function of pendulum-support
 displacement.
 As seen in Figure

As with the pendulum-distance and twist angle, we can use the pendulum photos
 to extract a tip-angle measurement.
 For each photograph of the pendulum, we used the pendulum-thickness-calibrated
 measurements of the apparent gap (again correcting for the factor of two
 from reflection) to determine the relative slope of the pendulum and its
 reflection in the foil.
 The average difference between the slopes (in units of gap pixels per pixel
 along the pendulum edge) of the science photographs and the inclined/on-foil
 photographs was taken as the pendulum tip angle of

\begin_layout Section
Foil Thickness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thickness of the foil was determined by making many micrometer measurements
 of foil from an adjacent portion of the same roll.
 Touching the foil, particularly with a hard/sharp-cornered object like
 a micrometer, can easily damage the foil by denting it.
 Even a piece of dust, compressed between a micrometer jaw and the foil,
 can be sufficient to dimple the foil and increase its effective thickness.
 For this reason, we have not directly measured the actual foil's thickness.
 If the foil thickness measurement were to become of increased concern,
 we could destructively test it.

\begin_layout Standard
As measured the foil is

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Assignment of attractor/foil separation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distance between the pendulum and the attractor is determined to be
 the sum of the pendulum-foil distance, the foil thickness, the attractor-foil
 distance, and the pendulum-angle correction.
 Both the statistical and systematic errors are summed in quadrature, as
 the systematic uncertainties quoted here are truly uncertain.
 We have chosen the central values for those measurements that have meaningful
 systematic uncertainty to reflect any bias we expect from these measurements.

Strategic choices and operation

This chapter describes important strategies and choices we made in the operation
 of the instrument: selecting the signal frequency, selecting the pendulum-angle
 signal as our science signal, random attractor locations, and the overall
 distribution of attractor locations.

Hz.
 This section describes the way in which important experimental frequencies
 were selected.
 The most-important frequency, the frequency with which the attractor changes
 position, is pushed by several concerns to the highest-feasible frequency.
 The limit of feasibility is set by both the limited speed with which our
 attractor drive can operate and by the speed with which the pendulum feedback
 control can react without adding extra noise.

\begin_layout Standard
For 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\gg\omega_{0}$
\end_inset

, the pendulum response is independent of the torsion spring.
 This is the torque equivalent of 
\begin_inset Formula $F=ma=m\ddot{x}\rightarrow\tilde{\tau}=I(-\omega^{2})\tilde{\theta}$
\end_inset

 ; at these frequencies, the pendulum acts like a free mass.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\ll\omega_{0}$
\end_inset

, the pendulum response is frequency independent.

Thermal Noise 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Fiber-thermal-noise"

\end_inset

, the torque noise power of a thermally-limited torsion balance is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tau^{2}(f)=4k_{B}T\frac{\kappa}{2\pi fQ}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This drives any measurement toward higher frequencies for decreased noise.
 In power spectral amplitude, the improvement only comes as 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\sqrt{f}$
\end_inset

, implying that the benefit of increased frequency is limited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Convolving this noise with the torque-to-angle transfer function (Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Approximate-torque-to-angle-tran"

\end_inset

), we recover the angle noise spectrum of a thermally-limited torsion oscillator.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Readout Noise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No physical measurement has arbitrary precision; we must consider the effects
 of finite-precision angle readout on our ability to measure torque.
 For simplicity, let our angle noise at all frequencies be 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\theta$
\end_inset

 (a practical approximation, see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Autocollimator noise"

\end_inset

).
 Our minimum resolvable torque signal at any given frequency is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta\tau(\omega)=\frac{\delta\theta}{T(\omega)}=\kappa\sqrt{\left(1-\frac{\omega^{2}}{\omega_{0}^{2}}\right)^{2}+\frac{1}{Q^{2}}}\delta\theta\approx\kappa\left|1-\frac{\omega^{2}}{\omega_{0}^{2}}\right|\delta\theta
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At frequencies above the pendulum resonance, torque noise rises with frequency.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Proximity Noise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Statistical-Uncertainty"

\end_inset

, the noise in the apparatus increases as the pendulum approaches the foil.
 In our frequency range of interest, it appears as relatively frequency-independ
ent noise.
 The level of this noise is time-dependent, correlated with wind, human
 activity, and both local and worldwide seismic activity.

The higher the attractor frequency

 In principle, given frequency-independent noise, the choice of signal frequency
 is arbitrary.
 If the noise power-spectral-density 
\begin_inset Formula $S(\omega)=S_{0}$
\end_inset

, then the resulting uncertainty of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 measurements each of duration 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{m}=1/f$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{all}=\sqrt{\frac{S_{0}}{Nt_{m}}}$

 If the measurements are performed in a fixed time

\begin_inset Formula $S(\omega)$
\end_inset

 is both time and frequency-dependent.
 Sudden/prominent events including earthquakes, human activity, attractor/foil
 interactions, and computer crashes happen.
 They are often short in duration, but overwhelming in amplitude.
 Measurements taken at these times are unusable.
 In this experiment, such transients happened at most a few times in a day.
 It will be shown in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 that for any large transient, measurements for at least 
\begin_inset Formula $30t_{m}=7680\mbox{\,\ s}=2.1\mbox{\,\ hr}$
\end_inset

 must be discarded.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{m}$

 were smaller, the experiment's fractional dead-time would be smaller.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second benefit to small 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{m}$
\end_inset

 is the increased number of independent measurements.
 This experiment relies upon Monte-Carlo-like measurements (random attractor
 locations) to constrain both systematic uncertainties and possible violations
 of the inverse-square law.
 Frequent individual measurements allow faster exploration of parameter
 space (exploring a 
\begin_inset Formula $6\times6$
\end_inset

 grid of measurements requires a day with the current choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{m}$
\end_inset

).
 Measurements that are twice as frequent allow twice as many questions to
 be answered, albeit with precision degraded by a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

.
 When noise is frequency-independent, there is no penalty for this approach.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Faster switching is better, much more than 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\mbox{better}}$

 noise and improved study of experimental parameter space.

Choosing a frequency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the first harmonic is the only signal of importance (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Harmonics"

\end_inset

), we should place the first harmonic at the location of lowest noise (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Experimentally-determined-noise"

\end_inset

).
 Furthermore, we are driven by statistics (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Statistics"

\end_inset

) to operate at the highest practical frequency.
 The required use of dead times to eliminate systematic uncertainties places
 a soft upper bound on usable frequencies (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Lags"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The operating frequency was chosen well in advance of the science run reported
 here, before the instrument was fully commissioned.
 We selected a frequency that we expected would give low noise and was sufficien
tly slow to allow transients associated with attractor motion to dissipate.
 We selected 3.90625

mHz, or

s is an integer (320) multiple of the 
\begin_inset CommandInset include

 This choice improves the performance of discrete Fourier analysis and minimizes

Switches per cut

\begin_layout Standard
The number of attractor position changes per `cut', a group of identical
 measurements, was chosen to be large-enough to allow a sufficient understanding
 of the switch-to-switch variation in the torque at each point.
 We settled on 10 switches per cut in an ad-hoc fashion.
 It provides a reasonable understanding of the switch-to-switch variation,
 and is still short-enough to address the speed concerns described in Section

\begin_layout Standard
As the pendulum is locked in feedback, there are multiple junctures in the
 feedback loop where a science signal could be extracted.
 The pendulum twist angle, the feedback signal itself, and the proportional,
 integral, and differential terms of the feedback loop are written to disk.
 The pendulum twist angle and the proportional term of the loop are equivalent.
 In practice, the twist signal and proportional term were anti-aliased different
ly before being written to disk.
 The proportional term had a 5
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s filter applied (a factor of 3 below the Nyquist frequency), making it
 the signal of choice for a reliable angle measurement.
 The loop was operated with zero integral-term to prevent improper wind-up
 in the challenging near-foil environment, so the integral channel contains
 no signal.
 The derivative-term response is frequency-dependent, growing roughly linearly
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

, making it unsuitable for low-frequency signal extraction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, there are two reasonable science channels: the feedback signal applied
 to the pendulum, and the proportional term.
 The feedback signal has units of torque, the proportional term has units
 of angle.
 Even though the pendulum is held fixed, the torque-to-angle transfer function
 matters.
 At frequencies below the resonance of the pendulum, the two channels are
 proportional.
 At frequencies above resonance, the frequency-independent angle noise of
 the autocollimator appears in the applied feedback signal, as torque noise
 that rises like frequency squared.
 As shown in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Harmonics"

\end_inset

 and Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Fourier Harmonics"

\end_inset

, the higher harmonics of the attractor motion contain no interesting signal,
 so it is in our interest to low-pass them away.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By choosing the angle/proportional-term signal instead of the feedback signal
 as the science signal, we use the inertia of the pendulum as an analog
 low-pass filter.
 While, in principle, both signals contain the same information, the science
 signal is more-readily extracted from the angle signal.
 Furthermore, as the feedback signal is the sum of the proportional and
 derived differential terms, if the science were extracted from the feedback
 signal there would be greater opportunity for software or digitization
 errors to introduce excess noise.
 Finally, we note that selecting among signal sources is straightforward
 with a continuous torque calibration signal operating at a nearby frequency.

 is the use of random attractor locations.
 This approach trades away some signal-to-noise in return for improved character
ization of systematic effects.
 Instead of focusing exclusively upon a small set of start and end locations
 for the attractor, we considered a large distribution of them.
 This method has the potential to expose important systematic curiosities,
 like the one described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 the distance-dependence of any measured force.
 The drawbacks of this approach, primarily additional complexity, are discussed
 in Sections

\begin_layout Standard
The random locations were generated by random number generator and written
 into configuration files for the attractor computer to execute.
 This extra step allows systematic tests that repeat the attractor positions
 used in science runs.
 The distribution of random attractor locations used was the simplest, and
 perhaps least efficient, uniform distributions of start and end positions.
 This spends perhaps more time than is most-efficient exploring shorter
 attractor-position differences.

The attractor positions were chosen by estimating the expected sensitivity

 As the statistical noise fluctuates significantly on a day-to-day basis,
 it was impossible to predict precisely the performance of the apparatus.
 A few reliable measurements during conditions of comparatively low noise
 can carry more statistical power than a day's worth of measurements in
 noisy conditions.
 As we used our blinded sensitivity for guidance, we are confident that
 we have not biased our experimental outcome by tuning into any desired
 result.
 In practice, this guidance led us to switch from predominantly

\begin_layout Standard
The measurements began with science data, comprising runs 3146/7 to 3166.
 Systematics tests followed; bellows valve-off in 3167--3172; resistor tests
 3174--3183; magnetic tests from 3184--3205; heating/thermistor tests from
 3206--3222; magnetic signal injection 3223--3225; attractor electrical
 bias 3234.
 Some runs preceding 3234 had the interferometer laser turned off; more
 archaeology awaits to determine if any torque sensitivity to interferometer-lig
ht-heating can be extracted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the future, interleaving systematics tests with science runs would be
 more satisfactory.
 With the exception of thermal tests, which have long time-constants, it's
 possible to do a science measurement, magnetic tests, interferometer on/off
 tests, and electrical bias tests programatically with each attractor setting,
 merging them into a single super-block of measurements that comprise a
 self-contained ISL test for one attractor-position pair.
 The ability to make incremental/aggregated ISL tests may be worth the added
 programming complexity.

 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 diagrams the flow of data through the data analysis code.
 This section provides a chronological narrative.
 The data analysis that precedes new-physics fits is functionally run twice,
 once using only the pendulum and attractor data streams, and once including
 the interferometer.
 As detailed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "par:A-conservative-approach"

\end_inset

, the interferometer data are only useful over parts of the run, requiring
 model-building in order to make a torque correction during times that the
 interferometer was unusable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Source data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data used in the analysis come from two sources, those that we determined
 externally and hand-entered and those sourced directly from the data acquisitio
n systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
External inputs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Externally-applied systematic injections and environmental variables (temperatur
e, magnetic field, etc.), were determined by hand (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Magnetism--systematic"

\end_inset

) or in separate analyses (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Temperature--systematic"

\end_inset

) on a run-by-run basis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, all experimental parameters (alignment, dimensions, densities,
 analysis parameters, etc.) are stored in global configuration files that
 are read by each analysis program that requires them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Data files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each data-acquisition computer generates its own data files.
 When the pendulum computer's data are read, externally-measured data are
 joined to the raw output from the pendulum DAQ.
 The timing data are then referenced to a common datum (00:00:00 January
 1, 2009 PST).

 of the experiment.
 A

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 refers to a length of coincident operation of two or more DAQ systems specifica
lly delineated by a run-configuration file as having something interesting
 to say.
 The main routine of the run-by-run analysis looks through the directory
 of run configuration files and analyzes the data loaded by each one.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, the data from each computer do not begin simultaneously and may have offsets
 between their clocks.
 We correct the differences in the clock rates and conservatively absorb
 the differences in clock zeroes into the assigned experimental dead times.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Filtering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Filtering"

\end_inset

, the torque data are passed through FIR filters, primarily to notch out
 the gravitational calibration signal and to bandpass away drift in the
 pendulum.
 All other channels to be analyzed alongside the torque data are passed
 through an inconsequential (low-pass at the Nyquist frequency), but equal
 duration, filter to guarantee phase-matching with the torque signal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Calibration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a parallel analysis with the filtering step, the torque data are calibrated
 using the gravitational calibration injection, as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Torque-Calibration"

\end_inset

.
 The calibration takes the form of a multiplicative constant, applied to
 the torque data in the

 step.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Lock-in
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The attractor moves in an 
\begin_inset Formula $ABABABABABABABABABAB$
\end_inset

 fashion.
 Before measuring the differences between state 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and state 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, it is necessary to phase-match the analysis to the phase of the attractor
 motion, as described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Edge-finding"

\end_inset

.
 The code finds rising edges in the attractor data and uses them to find
 the initial steps in the data.
 Using these steps, the code then projects, open-loop, the temporal location
 of all the steps in the dataset.
 The value of each signal channel is then measured during each step, using
 the dead-times projected in Section

 of ten attractor periods, after which the attractor's

 The code parses the data into these cuts, as referenced from the starting

 The first

 but are subjected to no further analysis.

Aggregation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the cuts from the many runs are aggregated into a single file (one for
 the pendulum/attractor two-DAQ analysis, and one for the three-DAQ interferomet

 These

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Interpretation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that the data are measured, what do they say? As the foil systematic
 is important, we first ascertain the size of any necessary correction due
 to foil motion.
 We then fit for the presence of any Yukawa signal.
 In addition, we perform an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

arbitrary fit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, a model-free approach to characterizing our measured signal, with less
 attention to systematic uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Interferometer branch
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the isolating foil moves in an attractor-correlated way, we need to know
 how much influence it may have on the pendulum.
 An optimal approach would have the foil interferometer operating continuously
 and in-range; it would then be possible to add a joint fit for the foil-motion-
to-torque constant to the global fit for new physics.
 As we only had partial coverage with the interferometer (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "par:A-conservative-approach"

\end_inset

), model-building is required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Interferometer foil-motion to torque constant
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As detailed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Pendulum-Foil-coupling"

\end_inset

, we displaced the attractor into contact with the foil and measured the
 attractor-displacement to torque transfer function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Attractor-position to foil-motion fit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As detailed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Data/Fit"

\end_inset

, we use the data from times when the interferometer was in-range to generate
 a piecewise-linear model of the foil displacement as a function of attractor
 position.
 The fit is bootstrapped to quantify the uncertainty in the extracted fit
 parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Foil-driven torque vs foil position model/correction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By combining the foil-motion-to-torque calibration with the modeled foil
 displacement as a function of attractor position, we construct a foil-motion-re
lated torque correction as a function of attractor position, with bootstrapped
 uncertainties, which can be applied to the entire dataset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Yukawa fit with systematics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As detailed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model-Comparison"

\end_inset

, the science signal and estimates for the magnitude of systematic effects
 are fit jointly.
 This bootstrapped fitting approach yields a distribution of best-fits in
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha-\lambda$
\end_inset

 space.
 The many bootstrapped fits of the attractor-driven foil-motion torque correctio
n are individually applied to these fits, allowing direct propagation of
 the correction uncertainty into the final fit results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Confidence intervals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many ways to draw two-dimensional confidence intervals from a
 distribution of best-fit points.
 We extract confidence intervals using an algorithm very similar in behavior
 to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

pick a lambda, fit for alpha
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 method that is traditional for inverse-square law tests, as seen in Section

.
\end_layout

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Arbitrary fit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just as for the foil displacement as a function of attractor position, we
 make a model-free piecewise-linear fit for the pendulum torque as a function
 of attractor position.
 Furthermore, by subtracting the foil-motion torque correction from this
 fit, we are able to compensate for any foil-motion systematic.
 This is perhaps the most intuitive and general result generated by the
 experiment.

 Throughout the operation of the experiment the revolving gravitational

s chunks and fit for a sinusoidal signal.
 The signal occurs at twice the quadrupolar gravitational calibrator's rotationa

 Both frequencies are allowed to float.

 The frequency is varied through a downhill binary search to minimize

 The time variation of the calibration signal is most-probably understood
 as slow drifts in the pendulum/foil/electrode spacing/alignment.
 It is also possible that some of the electronics involved in the feedback
 loop have had small gain drifts over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Calibration Systematics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As originally-designed, the calibration system had a magnetic-relay 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cycle-mark
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which would allow us to constrain the phase of the rotating attractor's
 motion.
 Both because the cycle-mark had reliability trouble and because the rotating
 magnet and associated electrical signals could inject a false signal of
 its own, the cycle-mark system was disabled, and the rotating magnet removed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The largest possible systematic signals (tilt and direct magnetic coupling
 to the pendulum magnetic moment) should appear at the rotating attractor's
 1-
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 frequency, not the critical 2-
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 gravitational signal frequency.
 While a resolved 1-
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 signal would occasionally appear, it was inconsistent and often absent;
 the 2-
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 calibration signal was far more consistent in fractional amplitude (see
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Gravitational-calibration"

\end_inset

).
 While an unintended 2-
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 signal is possible, perhaps through modulation of the background magnetic
 field, the acoustic environment (an acoustic modulation from the gravitational
 calibration system was seen during intential driven-loudspeaker studies
 of the foil interferometer), or the thermal environment, any of these effects
 should be small.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most-importantly, as this is a null experiment, with no absolute gravitational
 subtraction required, the calibration line is used primarily to set the
 torque scale and to show that the torque scale remains approximately stable
 throughout the experiment.
 For this reason, systematics on the calibration signal are not of grave
 concern.

Timing

\begin_layout Standard
Timing is an important weakness to this particular measurement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a major effort to guarantee that 
\bar under
no
\bar default
 electronic systematic coupling could occur between the attractor drive
 system and the pendulum and interferometer readout systems, the computers
 were electrically isolated.
 They share a common transformer-isolated power source, and a common electrical
 ground through a starred grounding arrangement (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Grounding"

\end_inset

), but no other connections.
 Of particular concern was the isolation of the analog-to-digital converting
 boards on each data-acquisition system; no shared signals were allowed
 between them.
 This arrangement appears to have worked very well (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Electrical-Crosstalk"

\end_inset

).
 The crux of this arrangement is understanding the synchrony of the three
 systems' timing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In retrospect, it is clear that an investment of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

week of work required to implement and debug a functional optically-isolated
 time distribution system would have paid great dividends.
 Instead, we chose to rely upon the gold-standard Network Time Protocol
 (NTP) time synchronization protocol 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "NTP"

\end_inset

 supported (we thought) by every major computer operating system.
 As designed, the three computers would resynchronize their clocks with
 an external reference (either time.nist.gov, or a common local time server
 referenced to time.nist.gov) every 3141 seconds.
 The computer clocks' relative drift rates are less than 10
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s/day, so continuous resynchronization would yield overall synchronization
 at better than the 1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s level at all times.
 Had this worked correctly, there would be no important timing concerns.
 In practice, the Windows Time service on at least one computer intermittently
 failed, forcing us to pay much closer attention to timing issues.
 With retrospective research we note that Microsoft states

 Such tolerances are outside the design specification of the W32Time service.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Caveat emptor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are at least ten clocks relevant to this analysis: the remote NIST-referen
ced Network Time Protocol (NTP) server, the user-space clocks on each of
 the three DAQ systems, the system clocks on each of the three DAQ systems,
 and the hardware clocks on each of the DAQ cards.
 The torsion-balance and attractor computers are of greatest importance,
 and share a common software codebase.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The user-space clocks are, in principle, resynchronized with the NTP clock
 regularly.
 The user-space clock values are written into the run header files at the
 beginning of each recorded run.
 The programs then make a call to the timeGetTime() function in the Windows
 API, and reference all time measurements to this datum.
 This function returns the number of milliseconds elapsed since the current
 session of Windows began.
 Critically, the returned value is from a user-immutable system clock, and
 not the user-space clock.
 No changes due to NTP-related synchronizations (or lack thereof) are evident
 in the data.
 Therefore, all runs that began with synchronized clocks share a common
 datum.
 At the ends of runs which terminated normally, the user-space clock (which
 is altered by NTP) is again written into the header file.
 This allows a cross-check on the duration of the run by cross-comparing
 the user-space and system-clock durations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each DAQ computer has both a system clock and a hardware clock in the DAQ
 card.
 The data-taking cadence is defined by the DAQ card.
 For both the pendulum-computer's internal NI-6259 and the two external
 USB NI-6211's used on the attractor and interferometer computers, the manufactu
rer guarantees the clock stability to 50 ppm, or 4 s/day.
 In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Clock-rates,-corrected"

\end_inset

, we use the NTP timing data to characterize the tick-rate stability of
 the system clocks and then use the stability of the system clocks to characteri
ze the stability of the DAQ hardware clocks.
 Furthermore, we use the NIST-synchronized NTP data to correct both the
 pendulum and interferometer computer's Windows clock tickrates to guarantee
 that they tick at equal rates.

Once we have characterized the clocks' stability, we can synchronize the
 clock rates.
 Of note is the fact that the attractor computer's DAQ sample rate differed
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-4}$
\end_inset

 from the other two computers.
 Fortunately, the attractor drive was timed by the attractor computer's
 clock, and not the DAQ clock, so no additional clock shifts were necessary,
 as the lock-in algorithm uses computer-clock time, not sample number.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the clock rates matched, we must then align the zeroes of each clock
 at the start of each run.
 The clocks were manually observed to be synchronous with sub-second precision
 in almost every run.
 In a few cases, they were observed to be asynchronous with as much as a
 25
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s offset.
 To be conservative, we assume that no run is synchronized to better than
 25
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s.
 Dropping 50
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s per step, or 100
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s per period, is a brutal but acceptable step, as the attractor-motion period
 is 256
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s.
 The installation of a simple time-distribution system will completely remove
 this source of uncertainty in the future, making sub-second synchronization
 straightforward in the future.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A minor concern was the occasional 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

clock roll
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 The timekeeping on the attractor and pendulum DAQ systems was referenced
 to the Windows clock, which reports time as a 32-bit integer number of
 milliseconds.
 If the DAQ program runs for more than 49 days without restarting, the 32-bit
 integer will overflow.
 These clock rolls are easy to detect and correct, so the analysis software
 automatically detects and corrects the few occasions on which they occur.

In this field, it is traditional to fit for and subtract the gravitational
 calibration tone, remove low frequency drifts on a per-cut basis through
 linear fits and average away unnecessary high-frequency information (often
 in hardware).
 In combination, these actions amount to the construction of a complicated
 filter, with interesting frequency dependence and phase behavior.
 The low-frequency linear fit is of particular interest, as a linear fit
 is

 orthogonal to a Fourier series.
 We trade the complex combination of filter-like fits for a single non-trivial

This procedure correlates three cuts.
 As the total science dataset consists of 
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand input
filename "../extracted/numberOfCuts.tex"

\end_inset

 cuts, the effect of cut-to-cut correlation is extremely small in aggregate.
 In addition, as attractor motion was either random or uniform, it should
 not introduce any systematic uncertainty.
 The 3-cut length of the FIR filter was chosen by balancing the need to
 sufficiently attenuate and frequency-select the injected calibration signal
 (pushes to longer-duration filters) with the need to reject the effects
 of spikes/kicks (earthquakes and attractor-foil contact).
 A spike, with amplitude orders of magnitude larger than the calibration
 tone, contaminates the entire FIR filter length with ringing.
 With a 3-cut filter, a single spike makes more than two hours data unusable;
 a longer filter (5-cut is the next symmetric choice) would be even less
 forgiving.

We must synchronize the data analysis cuts with the attractor motion.
 The first step in synchronizing is to find the square-wave edges.
 This is done by passing a simple edge-detection algorithm along the filtered
 data, looking for the first time the attractor's position passes through
 the mean position of the data set.
 Once this edge is found, the edge is projected backward in time, modulo
 the attractor step frequency, to find the first step.
 While crude, it is simple, and has proven reliable in synchronizing the
 analysis cuts with the data.

Windowing is familiar to many as a method for reducing the magnitude of
 spectral leakage in Fourier transforms.
 It is also useful in the time-domain as a low-pass filter, reducing the
 sensitivity of an averaged value to high frequency fluctuations at a modest
 expense in statistical resolving power.
 In this analysis, a Hann window is used

Once the dead times are chosen, a window selected, and a leading edge found,
 locking in is straightforward.
 Beginning at a time prescribed by a leading edge, the analysis program
 walks through each data stream, multiplies the data found in each `step
 period' (1/2 the attractor motion period) by the properly-delayed window
 function, and computes the weighted average.
 The resulting average forms a single measurement.

 The second measurement, and every-other subsequent measurement (the complement

\begin_layout Section
Bootstrap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis presented here makes extensive use of a statistical method
 called `the bootstrap' or `bootstrapping'.
 Its primary merit in this context is that it allows straightforward and
 reasonably robust estimation of confidence intervals.
 Bootstrapping relies upon the premise that the best estimator for the unknown
 distribution from which a data set is drawn is the data set itself.
 The idea is to `resample' the data to create synthetic data sets which
 may be passed through any analysis routine developed for the original data
 set.
 With repetition, this process generates distributions of important output
 quantities (best-fit points in the Yukawa 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha-\lambda$
\end_inset

 space, for example) without recourse to complex error estimation/propagation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resampling scheme used in this analysis was to generate synthetic data
 sets of the same size as the original set by randomly selecting measurements
 (there are always duplicate picks, except in the vanishingly rare case
 where the original data are recovered, out of order) from the initial data
 set.
 There is a related class of methods called `the jackknife' that generate
 statistics by considering complete sets of subsets of data, perhaps by
 dividing the initial data into subsets, fitting each subset, and drawing
 statistics from the fit outputs.
 The jackknife may be more readily accepted by those uncomfortable with
 the bootstrap; in the case of this measurement, there are too few measurements
 to allow meaningful statistics to be drawn from jackknifed fit outputs.
 Halving or quartering the dataset could be possible, but cutting it into
 ten pieces would result in too-little coverage in terms of varied attractor
 displacements.

 No matter how exotic the fitting function and how sensitive it might be

 is straightforward to bootstrap the data, fit, bootstrap again, fit, etc...
 The distribution of fit outcomes can always be studied, and qualitative
 understanding is immediate.

A weakness of bootstrapped analysis is its reliance upon computational power
 to produce useful results.
 If the dimension of a problem gets too high, it is difficult to ensure
 that fitting parameter spaces are well-explored.
 It is possible to include systematic effects into bootstrapped confidence
 intervals by modelling each systematic and injecting the expected amount
 of random uncertainty into the data to be fitted.
 If little is known about the systematic effect, however, this approach
 is challenging.

In the case of PlateWash, it is clear from inspection of Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 that when the effective Yukawa interaction range 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 becomes comparable to, or smaller than, the precision with which the attractor
 position is determined, the experimental sensitivity should be degraded.
 In the linearization approach, this corresponds to a diverging 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\sigma}_{f}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, linearizing 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-x/\lambda}$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{x}\gtrsim\lambda$

 is a recipe for trouble.

 In Equation

 diverges,

 is driven to zero.
 Any

 in which 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{G}^{2}$

 is huge.
 Thus, fits with smaller 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$

 are incorrectly preferred over perfectly reasonable fits with larger

 So, we return to the simple land of Monte Carlo tricks.
 We'll keep the linearized variance approach for the

 the effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{x}$

 the measured

 positions by a normally-distributed amount determined by each measurement's
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{x_{A}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{x_{B}}$

 This fuzzing process, in concert with the bootstrapping of the torque data,
 should distribute the best-fit points as expected from a more-sophisticated
 approach to error analysis.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

horizontal systematic errorbars
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 As the determination of the absolute separation of the pendulum and foil,
 and hence the pendulum and attractor is necessarily uncertain (see Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

), this must be reflected in degraded confidence intervals at small 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 From the perspective of our global fit, this measurement is unchanging,
 making it a systematic uncertainty (and, indeed, it contains its own systematic
 uncertainties).
 The

fuzzing

 process introduced above is readily adapted to this concern.

 This approach naturally incorporates our absolute position uncertainty

\begin_layout Standard
There is no unique method for drawing two-dimensional confidence intervals.
 The method we selected was chosen for its clarity after exploring more
 sophisticated methods (kernel density estimators among them).
 The most important lesson from our investigation of differing methods is
 the notion that, 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
, the Yukawa 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 have nothing to do with one another.
 Any attempt to constrain them jointly makes a prior assumption about their
 relationship.
 The long-standing tradition in this field is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pick a lambda and fit for alpha
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 approach, which sidesteps any presupposition of covariance.
 What we do is in that spirit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The outcome of the bootstrapped Yukawa fits is a distribution of best-fit
 points in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha-\lambda$
\end_inset

 plane.
 Working from small 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 to large 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, we compute the mean 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 and standard deviation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

s of the subset 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 composed of the first 
\begin_inset CommandInset include
LatexCommand input
filename "../extracted/NBinConfInterval.tex"

\end_inset

 best-fit point.
 This number is chosen as the square-root of the number of bootstrapped
 points in order to limit over-zealous fluctuations of the confidence interval
 curves.
 We then plot four points, 
\begin_inset Formula $(\lambda_{min},m_{\alpha}\pm2\sigma_{\alpha})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(\lambda_{max},m_{\alpha}\pm2\sigma_{\alpha})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{min}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{max}$
\end_inset

 are the smallest and largest 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

s of points in the subset.
 We then remove the point corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{min}$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, add the next point with 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{max}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, and repeat the procedure.

\begin_layout Standard
The two envelopes defined by the four lines that emerge define the 95% confidenc
e intervals for our best fits.
 Regions that are excluded by both envelopes are certainly excluded at 95%
 confidence.
 Regions that are included by both are included at 95% confidence.
 Regions excluded by only one envelope are indeterminate; we've roughly
 quantified the uncertainty on our confidence interval.
 The volume of the indeterminate region can be made arbitrarily small by
 computing greater numbers of best-fit points.
 In regions where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is a strong function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, convergence is necessarily slow.
 The final confidence-interval plots can be found in Section

In addition to extracting model parameters from the data, we can reconstruct
 the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(d)$
\end_inset

, the pendulum torque as a function of attractor/pendulum separation.
 The entire data set consists of differential measurements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(d)$
\end_inset

, where the experiment measures a 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau=\tau(d_{1})-\tau(d_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 Recovering 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(d)$
\end_inset

 is then similar to recovering a function using knowledge of its derivative.
 Just as in indefinite integration, there is a

The method used to recover 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(d)$
\end_inset

 is simple -- attempt to find a best-fit function which minimizes the difference
 between the measured torques 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau_{meas}$
\end_inset

 and those computed using the fitting function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau_{fit}$
\end_inset

.
 To provide confidence intervals on the fit parameters, we bootstrap the
 measured data many times; the distribution of the extracted fit parameters
 provides the necessary foundation.

\begin_layout Section
Blindness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most accurate experiments are free of bias.
 It is possible to perform an unbiased experiment without a blind, but it
 is difficult to guarantee that all pre-concieved notions of experimental
 results and implications are suppressed.
 Critics of blind experiments claim that, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no experiment is truly blind,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in reference to the current reality that experimenters unblind their results
 privately prior to public dissemination of the result.
 This is true, but it hides the power of the blind -- forcing complete and
 equal attention to each 
\emph on
known
\emph default
 systematic effect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PlateWash is not an entirely blind experiment.
 It is a precursor to a blind experiment.
 More than half of the science data were taken without a blind, largely
 because we had not discovered a way to monitor the health of the experiment
 without access to data which included the central values of each measurement.
 During that time, it became clear that monitoring the distribution of the
 errorbars of each cut was sufficient to ensure nothing was going wrong
 within the instrument.
 Once that determination was made, we blinded ourselves to the central values
 of all torque measurements.
 All of the systematic investigations were performed blind.
 In this first iteration of PlateWash, our understanding of the instrument's
 metrology was in continuous refinement, which blocked any attempt to inject
 a fake signal into the data as they were acquired.
 Furthermore, the intentional physical separation between pendulum and attractor
 DAQ systems would make injecting a fake signal extremely difficult.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data analysis was performed blind.
 Critically, the foil-systematic coupling and cuts were not determined until
 many months after the data had been acquired.
 Even if the experiment had been tuned during the commissioning of the instrumen
t, our blind systematic tests and subsequent analysis have the power to
 expose several classes of tuning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Blinding procedure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the analysis, we blinded ourselves to the central values of all measureme
nts by avoiding looking at the torque data directly.
 This is, of course, a challenge when operating a torsion balance, as the
 best measure of proper function of is the character of the torque data.
 Furthermore, important steps, such as calibration, must necessarily operate
 upon unblinded data.
 Therefore, we used a combination of data-analysis design and an honor code
 to minimize any chance of seeing the experimental results before the analysis
 was finalized.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make it difficult to accidentally see any analyzed data, immediately
 following the lock-in step (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Lock-in"

\end_inset

), the central values of all torque-related data in each cut were set to
 zero.
 All testing of post lock-in data analysis was done by injecting synthetic
 signals and noise into those central values.
 This allowed us to ensure that the data-analysis system worked correctly
 without accidentally viewing blinded data.
 Unblinding the experiment is as simple as disabling this blinding mechanism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the approximate systematic tests detailed in Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Systematic-Tests"

\end_inset

, we separately saved the unblinded results of the lock-in procedure.
 These measurements were then compared only as blind-differences, where
 measurements with an external parameter changed were subtracted from measuremen
ts with the external parameter nulled.
 This procedure allows us to determine the experimental susceptibility to
 external parameters without having any access to the central values of
 either measurement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Blinding failures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All systems fail, and this fairly fragile blinding system was no exception.
 Early in the blind analysis, we viewed the unblinded outcome of the lock-in
 twice.
 The more-important occasion was during the development of the blinding/unblindi
ng code.
 A bug in the blinding code led to one of us (Charlie) seeing a Yukawa fit
 that resolved a signal with 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda<20$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m, 
\begin_inset Formula $|\alpha|\sim10^{3\pm2}$
\end_inset

, and with indeterminant sign.
 This pre-dated our determination of systematic cuts, particularly those
 related to the foil; the indeterminacy of the sign of the observed signal
 is particularly important.
 We don't know whether our later determinations added to, subtracted from,
 or eliminated this signal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This type of failure of the blind is a weakness to software-blinds in null
 measurements.
 Often, the best estimate of an instrument's proper operation is its output.
 In a software-blinded null measurement, the experimenter is forced to perpetual
ly dance around any accidental observation of the result.
 A reliable hardware-implemented blind, such as a clock skew, a hard-coded
 unknown offset, or an unknown stable experimental parameter is much more
 resistant to innocent mistakes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We look forward to using what we've learned on the next iteration of this
 experiment, as at least the known pitfalls of this blinding procedure can
 be avoided.

 For a blinded experiment with an automated unblinding procedure, this is

Testing

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unit tests are used to verify that each individual function in a project
 delivers the expected output.
 If individual program units have failings, it is impossible for an assembly
 of those program units not to contain failures.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Testing is perhaps best explained by example.
 In our field, it is customary for everyone to regard the normalization
 of any FFT program as suspect until proven otherwise.
 One of the standard checks is to verify that the integrated real-space
 power and the integrated Fourier-space power are equal.
 People usually try a few inputs until they're approximately satisfied that
 the results behave as expected.
 What if that were programatic? If, before you made serious use of a library,
 you could hit `test', and the software could run a predefined set of such
 tests? It is 
\emph on
much
\emph default
 easier to check whether a test is written correctly than it is to verify
 that code is correctly-written.
 Testing is a requisite part of quality software development, and data analysis
 is software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is further possible to do 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

integration testing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, where the outputs of functions of functions are checked for sanity.
 There is very little integration test coverage in this project.
 As a partial check, many of the plots rendered throughout this thesis will
 allow the reader to verify that the analysis is approximately correct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Octave has a straightforward syntax for integrating unit tests into functions.
 Before the PlateWash analysis begins, the entire set of homespun Octave
 libraries is automatically tested.
 At present, this software project has insufficient formal testing coverage.
 This is improving, but our first results must be delivered before testing
 coverage is complete.
 As the testing coverage grows, the integrity of the project, too, will
 grow.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The code used in our Newtonian gravitational calculations (Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 unit-testing makes available to the discerning physicist.

Advantages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The advantages of having a dynamic ability to alter the data analysis at
 any point in the entire project and be certain that correctly-processed
 numbers, analysis, and plots will appear in the final text cannot be understate
d.
 This makes collaboration with others straightforward, as there's no fear
 that large portions of an analysis will have to be

 in response to changes early in the analysis process; it gets automatically

 every night.
 In addition, this ability is critical to unblinding a sophisticated analysis;
 complex processes proven to work on simulated data can be applied directly
 to real data when the time comes.
 Finally, and of greatest importance, the entire process is replicable;
 anyone studying this experimental result can know exactly what was done.

 is essential to have the ability to simulate the forces and torques between
 arbitrary mass configurations.
 Furthermore, the calculations must be sufficiently simple that they may
 be easily audited.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While it is less computationally-efficient, and can have numerical rounding
 concerns, we have chosen to simulate the Newtonian signals in PlateWash
 by breaking field and test masses into aggregations of many small point
 masses and computing the simple sums of forces and torques between them.
 Done this way, there is only the inverse square law to implement correctly.

Superposition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The planar sheets utilize a critical principle of superposition.
 In the region where the pendulum-attractor separation is comparable to
 the grid spacing, any pointwise calculation of forces and torques is almost
 guaranteed to be erroneous or require careful attention.
 This difficulty can be bypassed entirely by superposition.
 The gravitational field from a cylindrical sheet can be computed either
 directly, or by computing the force from a large annulus that represents
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

missing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 mass from an infinite sheet that the cylindrical sheet purports to represent
 and subtracting it from the known-uniform force due to an infinite sheet.
 As all pointwise separations are large in the latter case, any residual
 effects of grid overlap are small indeed.

The Newtonian influence of gas flowing into and out of the bellows is easily

 We model it as a cylinder with 7 axial grid points and 7 lateral grid points.
 The dimensional change of the bellows is quite small relative to the separation
 from the pendulum and is near the pendulum's center-line, so the mass-appearanc
e should be the dominant gravitational effect.

 Clever tricks can help to reduce the necessary volume of computation somewhat,

 we must find a way to tolerate much lower resolution.

We spent a lot of time trying to find clever ways to execute a satisfactory
 parallel-plate test of the inverse square law without a measurement of
 the isolating foil's position.
 We were unable to find a way.
 For experiments of this type, where the attractor is modulated toward and
 away from the an isolating foil, estimates of the sensor/foil coupling
 and the foil motion itself are essential.
 This is the first measurement of which we are aware to make an on-line
 measurement of the isolating foil's displacement; an important step forward.

 for other drifts in the instrument.

) we added to control the fiber-tip/foil separation.
 Without it, we spent hours attempting to position the fiber by hand for
 proper fringe contrast.
 As the fiber-foil separation is on the order of tens of microns, it is
 a delicate operation.
 On one somber occasion, we punctured a foil with the fiber tip, requiring
 a new foil and complete realignment/cleaning of the experiment.
 The current system is simple and suffers the backlash and imprecision inherent
 in servo actuation, but it is sufficient to gain useful control over fringe
 contrast.

 It was only when we tried essentially-random stroke lengths that the prominent
 effect appeared.

This effect drove us to make two major changes:

\begin_layout Itemize
Pneumatic attractor position metrology: This systematic effect made it clear
 that electrical pickup within the apparatus could become a concern.
 By using to the precision pressure gauge as a way of ascertaining the attractor
's position, it was possible to do a complete end-to-end test for any electrical
 pickup associated with the attractor (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Attractor-position-control"

).
 Once the pressure gauge was shown to be a useable encoder by intercomparison
 with the position encoder, the position encoder was turned off and disconnected
 for the duration of the experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Strong emphasis on random/Monte Carlo-like attractor positioning.
 For any given lengthscale and interaction type, there is, in general, an
 optimum square-wave attractor motion to hunt for it.
 Random positioning helps to elucidate any strange systematic effects, and

What we did not do, and should have, was to hunt down the way by which the
 encoder signal coupled to the experiment.
 The encoder operates at internal lock-in frequencies from 1-25
\begin_inset space ~

MHz, with delicate grounding requirements.
 We presume that the cross-coupling was through the autocollimator; exposed
 and unshielded leads extend for several inches within the vacuum chamber
 between the autocollimator's position-sensitive photodiode outputs and
 the high-gain transimpedance preamplifiers.
 This is an obvious target for future upgrades of the experiment (Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 It is straightforward to shorten the leads by an order of magnitude and
 implement full electrical shielding for the photodiode and preamplifiers.

 for the attractor, foil, and pendulum.
 A simplified grounding schematic is shown in Figure

\begin_layout Standard
It was decided early in the experiment (

2007-8) to ground the pendulum directly to the internal grounding block,
 which defines our experiment's electrical ground (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Grounding"

\end_inset

).
 Furthermore, it was observed early on that the addition of 0.1-10
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

M
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 resistors to the grounding of the attractor and foil gave improved noise
 and killed off any inexplicable signals we saw.
 This was very early in our understanding of the instrument.
 It felt like fine-tuning, but both because we routinely operate torsion
 balances with 10-100
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

k
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 resistors in series with the torsion fiber as protection from electric
 transients and because the equilibration time of even a nanofarad capacitance
 across a megaohm resistor is 
\begin_inset Formula $>10^{5}$
\end_inset

 times shorter than the signal period, we left the resistors in and turned
 to more-pressing concerns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Later, the worries that we had fine-tuned the apparatus and that at higher
 frequencies, the foil and attractor were effectively electrically floating
 resurfaced, and we decided that it would be wise to bypass the resistors
 with large capacitors.
 We made that change and proceeded for years to refine the instrument.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 2012, prior to our science campaign, the experiment was not blind, and
 an apparent inverse-square-law-violating signal was clearly resolved.
 The signal was too large to have been an ISL violation, as prior experiments
 would have trivially resolved it.
 At a suggestion from Krishna Venkateswara, the wires leading to the capacitors
 were clipped (at the same time we altered the lock-in frequency and, alas,
 separately disconnected the contact-potential control system), and the
 signal vanished, dropping into the noise resolvable overnight.
 In addition, the instrumental performance improved.
 Re-introducing the capacitors restored the signal, and shorting out the
 resistor with a wire also yielded a large signal.
 With no other reasons to believe that the experiment had a problem, we
 began the science run reported in this thesis shortly thereafter, with
 the capacitors removed.

Identifying the resonance gives us a culprit, but not a mechanism.
 Our best guess as to how a tunable resonance might influence the torque
 signal follows similar reasoning as in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Encoder-narrative"

\end_inset

; while the attractor encoder is left unpowered, an encoder monitoring the
 fiber position perpendicular to the foil is left powered and operating
 in order to retain datum information.
 This encoder may be radiating RF power in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim1$
\end_inset

-
\begin_inset Formula $25$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

MHz realm; easily in range of the expected LC resonant frequencies.
 If the static encoder's RF signal couples to the autocollimator, and that
 signal is modulated by the presence of a new resonance in the experimental
 environment, a false apparent torque could emerge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, the presence of the foil allows a second possible, though less
 likely, coupling mechanism.
 Any mechanical resonance or displacement that could be driven by a resonance-en
hanced effective attractor-foil or pendulum-foil voltage could also appear
 as a false torque.

This chapter describes individual systematic tests to give us an approximate
 picture of this measurement's systematic susceptibilities.
 As described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "sec:Model-Comparison"

\end_inset

, the global impact of important systematics on physics results is determined
 within a single fit.
 These smaller analyses are more-interpretable and give insight into the
 outcome of individual systematic tests.

For most systematic tests, we operated the experiment with square-wave short-str
oke and long-stroke attractor positions, seen easily in the right half of
 Figure

 The short-stroke spanned the

m farthest from the foil.
 The analyses in this chapter are blind to gravity; torque measurements
 are intercomparisons between two square wave measurements, suppressing
 any common-mode gravitational information.
 Blindness is preserved by subtracting torque data measured without any
 externally-applied influence from torque data measured with an externally-appli
ed systematic influence.
 In the case of the magnetic field systematic, we also considered the difference
 between data taken with applied fields of opposite sign.

 The sensors are hand calibrated to match each other and the exterior sensors

 As the primary purpose of these sensors was to monitor the size of the

 By virtue of the greater heat capacity of the attractor and the impedance
 of the spindles, the attractor-face temperature variation should be smaller.
 Dimensionally, this temperature change is of no consequence; both the attractor

 In this analysis, we do not explicitly search for this effect, but it is
 possible to do.
 A weaker signal-for or defense-against a non-conservative torque curve
 is the automatic intrinsic inflation of the distribution of the bootstrapped
 best-fit points in searches for new physics; biased sampling of short/long
 strokes may, however, lead to inaccurate fit results.

As we do not have continuous full-sensitivity coverage of the entire measurement
 with the interferometer, we must build a model of the foil displacement
 as a function of attractor position and then apply it (with known uncertainties
) via the foil-to-torque transfer function (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Pendulum-Foil-coupling"

\end_inset

) to generate the foil-related torque-difference expected for attractor-position
 pair.
 To be conservative, we use the piecewise-linear technique outlined in Section

Subtracting the foil-related torque is delicate.
 If we get the sign of the effect wrong, we double the systematic signal
 instead of subtracting it.
 For this reason, we will present our final results with the signal subtracted,
 with no subtraction, and with the signal added, so the importance of the
 effect will be apparent to the reader.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, we must address the uncertainty in the subtraction.
 To do so, when bootstrapping the model fit, with each bootstrap, we subtract
 a different one of the bootstrapped fits from

\end_inset

So, what are you going to do after you unblind? Are there extra tests you're
 going to do? What if you see something? If you do something different if
 you get a null result than if you see a signal, doesn't that partially
 defeat the point of having a blind?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Discussion and introspection that followed led to the inclusion of this
 essential section of the thesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every blind measurement should have a statement written prior to unblinding
 that explains what the experimenters think the measurement means.
 Unaddressed sources of systematic uncertainty (i.e.
 if we see something unexpected, what might it be?) must be enumerated.
 Possible experiments needed to constrain them should be suggested.
 Any post-unblinding experimental tests must be enumerated and, in most
 cases, invariant under whether or not a signal is seen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The

 is a qualitative companion to an error budget.
 If there are few residual concerns, it can be short.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Unaddressed systematic uncertainties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The interferometer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we moved to unblind, careful consideration of the sign of the reconstructed
 foil-displacement signal led us to realize that the reconstruction algorithm
 is more susceptible to the effect of fringe turning points than originally
 believed.
 Without understanding the sign-flips at the fringe turning points, there
 is a danger that the measured foil movement could be underestimated by
 an aggregate measurement.
 This statement is being written with about a week to go until unblinding,
 as we must allow for computation time to analyze the data.
 More analysis is on the way, and will be presented at the unblinding and
 in future pre-unblinding commits.
 Periodic absolute calibration of the sign of the interferometer signal,
 perhaps by making tiny displacements of the interferometer tip in a known
 direction, would resolve this ambiguity entirely.
 
\emph on
A pre-unblinding note: Subsequent analysis since the beginning of unblinding,
 and before the result is known, suggests that the degree of suppression
 should be relatively small.
 Determining the absolute sign of the foil's displacement in time for the
 unblinding will elude us.
 Thus, we will take our limits considering both sides of the interferometer
 signal.
 If a resolved signal appears when both the interferometer signal is added
 
\bar under
and
\bar default
 subtracted, it is probably not due to a foil-motion effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Pendulum-foil attractor-correlated contact potential variation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As referenced above, a small variation in pendulum-foil contact potential
 could yield an inverse-square-law violating signal, should the change somehow
 contain information about the attractor-foil spacing.
 If it does not have access to spacing information, it would tend to be
 a smooth, perhaps linear, function of attractor displacement.
 It is possible to hunt for such an effect by biasing the attractor and
 foil together with respect to the pendulum, increasing the influence of
 the small 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta V$
\end_inset

 voltage as 
\begin_inset Formula $(V+\delta V)^{2}\approx V^{2}+V\delta V$
\end_inset

.
 It's a tricky measurement to make, as the pendulum-foil coupling will increase
 like 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{2}$
\end_inset

, but it's not impossible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Magnetism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a number of unaddressed small magnetic effects.
 While we have measured the magnetic fields of our pendulum and attractor
 to available sensor precision, and the active elements were acid-cleaned,
 it remains possible that there are magnetic impurities in our materials
 that could give rise to an inverse-square-law violating effect.
 These effects should be small, however, as ferromagnetic impurities must
 be fairly sizeable and concentrated before they become important.
 Our group's rotary magnetic-sensing turntable would allow us to place tighter
 constraints upon any magnetic effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Metrology uncertainty (dust)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have photographic evidence that the pendulum and foil alignment agreed
 with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bounce
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plateau
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 tests, limiting the size of any possible dust that might have compromised
 the more-quantitative measurements.
 Our attractor-foil separation and resolved interferometer signal may provide
 a hint of dust present in the attractor-foil gap.
 While we don't expect the dust to substantially affect our overall measurement
 of attractor-foil spacing (misalignment and dust would yield similar signals),
 if it did, it would affect only our claimed 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, not the presence or absence of an inverse square law violation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Pendulum/Attractor deformation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible that the pendulum or attractor has deformed while under vacuum,
 as did some of our earlier masses.
 If the pendulum inlays deformed slightly, it will only act to alter our
 metrology, not the presence or absence of a violation.
 If the attractor deformed, it is possible that the null-ness of the attractor
 could be compromised, in addition to altering metrology.
 Re-scanning these masses with the SmartScope will yield sufficient information
 to make this determination.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Interferometer heating
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we performed a test to check whether the interferometer's localized
 light might have heated the foil enough to open a thermal or outgassing
 mechanism of communication between the pendulum and attractor, a record-keeping
 lapse prevented us from making any quantitative statements.
 We know which run marks a return to laser-on operation, but we don't know
 with certainty which run began the laser-off period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we don't expect this to be a major concern, it's not impossible, and
 it is testable in a future iteration of the experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Casimir
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We don't believe that the Casimir effect can get through the isolating foil,
 but we can't prove it won't (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Casimir-effect"

\end_inset

).
 The possibility of a Casimir subtlety should be entertained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Timing (this point added after unblinding had begun, but before the result
 was known)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Presuming that there is at least a small linear background torque, as expected,
 it is possible to use the torque data to directly synchronize the attractor-com
puter and pendulum-computer clocks.
 If there is an error in our synchronization, correlation analysis may allow
 its detection and resolution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
If a signal is resolved
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It might be new physics, it might be one of the above systematic effects,
 or it might be something we missed.
 While that sentence is tautological, it leads us forward.
 If the signal is new physics, it will survive future tests.
 It is possible to evaluate many of the above systematics readily, in some
 cases with external measurements, in others by repeating the measurement
 with upgrades.
 If the systematic is something inherent to our apparatus, repeated experiments
 by others in the field, or with completely different designs, like our
 group's wedge-pendulum apparatus, will help to improve everyone's understanding
 of Nature.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any repetition of our experiment should be performed blind.
 Remaining blind has helped us so much in identifying previously unknown
 systematics and properly characterizing known ones.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
If a signal is not resolved
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everything in the resolved-signal section above applies.
 If a measurement is important to the physics community, null or no, it
 should be rechecked and confirmed by others.
 The only reasons to stop hunting for both greater sensitivity and experimental
 certainty are if the level of measurement precision substantially exceeds
 theoretical prediction or if no major experimental improvements are feasible.
 In the case of short-range gravity, the former is unlikely to happen in
 our lifetime, and the latter is precluded by our short list of easy experimenta
l upgrades.
 PlateWash is worth doing at least one more time.

 Points surviving that cut are shown in horizontal/vertical crosses.
 Points surviving all cuts, including minimum and maximum chi-squared (horizonta

 That the majority of fits have reduced-

The field of avalanche safety, and professional risk management more generally,
 shares its soul with experimental physics: the control of systematic uncertaint
y.
 In the case of avalanches, if you underestimate your uncertainty more than
 a few times, you die.
 If you overestimate your uncertainty, you never get to experience the joy
 found among mountains.
 For physicists, the situation is similar; if we report a violation of the
 vaunted Newton's Inverse Square Law Of Gravitation, and it's not true,
 our careers are damaged, if not ended.
 If we cower in fear of uncertainty, we'll never learn anything new about

 A rotating torsion balance with test masses of equal gravitational mass
 but differing composition looks for a composition-dependent differential
 acceleration toward a distant attractor mass.
 In this experiment, the science signal appears at the rotation frequency.
 For both earth-fixed and astronomical field masses, the measurement can
 be distilled to two numbers -- the in-phase and out-of-phase components
 of a torsion balance signal.
 For these experiments, while the execution and source-mass determination
 can be challenging, it is relatively straightforward to write down the
 error budget.
 For each source of systematic uncertainty, one need only determine the
 magnitude of the external influence and its coupling to the instrument.
 From there, the effect on the overall measurement can be estimated.

 This is a critical difference from our inverse-square law experiments.

, the situation is similar, but more complicated.
 A mass distribution with 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-fold symmetry is suspended horizontally on a torsion balance.
 Below it is placed a similar 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-fold-symmetric field mass.
 The field mass is rotated smoothly, and the 
\begin_inset Formula $N\omega$
\end_inset

 in-phase and out-of-phase torque signals on the torsion balance are measured.
 In an important difference from the Equivalence Principle tests, the field
 mass is then displaced relative to the pendulum and the measurement repeated.
 In this way, these experiments can be viewed as a collection of Equivalence-Pri
nciple-style measurements.
 Each measurement can be used independently to constrain new interactions
 in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha-\lambda$
\end_inset

 plane.
 Taken together, however, it is a greater challenge to estimate the ensemble's
 sensitivity to systematic uncertainties.
 For each source of systematic error, a model of the systematic effect and
 its pendulum coupling must be constructed as a function of height.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the PlateWash experiment, things are even more complicated.
 For each individual cut, we have the choice of start and end positions.
 While this extra dimension of flexibility gives us extra discriminating
 power between specific inverse-square law violations, it also requires
 that we have an even better model of each systematic effect.
 With the intentionally myriad choices of start and end positions that we
 used in this experiment, ascertaining both our sensitivity to a specific
 inverse square law signal and our uncertainties became a real challenge.
 The methods outlined in Sections 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model-Comparison"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Force-law-inversion"

 now allow us to do this relatively efficiently, but it can be challenging
 to extract or judge a physics result by eye.
 The two-parameter approach is powerful for discriminating against instrumental
 effects, but the loss in clarity is substantial.

Size
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We don't yet know with confidence what the optimal spatial size of active
 elements in an inverse square law experiment might be.
 The smaller the active elements, the more-easily they can be aligned.
 Larger sizes yield larger lever arms for torsion balances and more-uniform
 gravitational fields.
 The very direct geometry of the Huazhong apparatus 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "2007PhRvL..98t1101T"

\end_inset

 addresses the former concern, providing both easy alignment and a long
 lever arm at the possible expense of larger Newtonian gravity backgrounds.
 The scaling laws for proximity-enhanced noise with distance/area are strongly
 dependent upon the underlying phenomena (patch fields, gas molecule rearrangeme
nt, proximity-enhanced gas damping, etc), which are, at best, partially
 understood.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will continue to experiment with size in an effort to improve our signal
 to noise ratio.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Foil-displacement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We spent about a year trying to find ways to avoid the need to measure the
 foil's position before taking on the problem directly with the foil interferome
ter.
 In our opinion, for any attractor-displacing short-distance gravity experiment,
 a measure of the isolating foil's displacement is essential.
 Without such a measurement, substantial systematic-uncertainty questions
 will linger.
 The foil interferometer is one of the major successes of this experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Capacitor/contact potential
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The decision to simultaneously remove both the bypass capacitors and the
 contact-potential system was over-eager, though we didn't know it at the
 time.
 Had we ascertained that the systematic signal we saw was related only to
 the capacitors, we could have significantly improved the sensitivity of
 the overall measurement through decreased noise and decreased pendulum-foil
 coupling.
 Indeed, the most important single upgrade of the experiment will be to
 reconnect those systems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It remains important for us to determine the mechanism by which the capacitor-mo
dulated resonance couples to the pendulum/pendulum readout.
 Addressing that coupling, which probably resides in the autocollimator
 pre-amplifier, may yield improved noise and decreased systematic sensitivity.
\end_layout

The most important errors we've made are ones of strategy.
 Just as months in the lab can save you hours in the library

, small strategic errors can have large consequences over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Error Budget
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps the most important single concept when planning an experiment is
 the formation of a complete error budget.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our single biggest mistake is the lack of a complete quantitative error
 budget.
 This seems like a childish oversight, but it's inherent to every modern
 short-range gravity experiment because it is extremely difficult to do.
 When we proposed the experiment, we submitted an approximate error budget
 for a single square-wave operation of the experiment, focused on 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\sim20-70$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m.
 As the exclusion limits span orders of magnitude in both 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, it is difficult to build reliable models for the influence of each systematic
 at all points in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha-\lambda$
\end_inset

 plane.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Error budgets provide the guidance necessary for keeping experiments from
 going adrift.
 To operate without them is to operate without a rudder, reliant upon intuition
 alone for direction.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Blitzkreig vs Campaign
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While it was first imagined as a short-range equivalence principle test,
 and again as a competing design idea to the early Eöt-Wash 10-hole pendulum
 design, PlateWash, as it exists now, was sold in 2006-7 as a chance to
 jump ahead of the existing technology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our action mirrored this blitzkreig philosophy.
 The goal was to push for the single best measurement we could get, as quickly
 as we could.
 We put off complete solutions to systematic concerns in favor of estimates
 and a promise to tie up loose ends when the measurement was complete.
 When the experiment was first assembled, our first day of data easily surpassed
 the first Eöt-Wash short-range experiments; we were on our way, led by
 the huge potential of PlateWash's efficient design.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our committment to the lightning-strike approach, where we would get a great
 measurement on our first try, led us astray; the first strikes didn't work.
 Complete focus on delivering a respectable result instead of iteratively
 delivering coarse but reliable results slowed our progress.
 Without building a foundation of complete measurements on which we could
 stand, grow, and improve, we condemned ourselves to inefficiency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Complexity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PlateWash is a very simple experiment.
 Its simplicity is perhaps its second-strongest feature (behind the intrinsicall
y-null nature of the short-range field from the attractor).
 In pursuing the random attractor motion, blind analysis, and auditable/repeatab
le analysis software, I severely underestimated the implied complexity of
 each.
 Correct execution of all of them are necessary to yield a maximally-believeable
 result, but each one has generated a year or more's worth of work.
 Constrained complexity must be a hallmark of future short-range experiments.
 PlateWash has led the way into new areas and generated new tools to simplify
 each of these complex tasks, but we must be mindful of the pitfalls to
 which it's been subject.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Blindness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prior to PlateWash, our group has only done one measurement effectively
 blind, when an important experimental parameter was undocumented during
 the duration of the experiment and subsequent analysis.
 It was not by choice.
 The approach taken with this work is designed to directly address the (reasonab
le) objection that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no experiment is ever truly blind
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 -- hinting at the reality that most blind experiments unblind before making
 their work public.
 The repeatable analysis, open git commit log, and the public unblinding
 of the experiment are all designed to address this concern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The systematic influences in known short-range gravity experimental configuratio
ns are too delicate to work with without a blind.
 How else will you know when to stop looking for uncertainties? The next
 giant leap in this field will come with an entirely new and simpler experimenta
l idea; one where it is obviously free from large classes of systematic
 uncertainty.
 In the early days of those experiments, perhaps no blind will be requisite.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As this measurement comes to a close, while the blind remains stressful,
 it is also refreshing.
 We have done what we can to mitigate known systematic effects.
 The result, whatever it will be, is as unaffected by our own biases as
 we could manage.
 If our measurement is to be repeated, it should be performed blind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Social
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may have been a mistake to have insisted so strongly that we follow the
 paths of replicable analysis and blindness.
 Both approaches are new to our research group.
 To depart on a headstrong approach to an analysis without gaining consensus
 from within the team was dangerous.
 Without buy-in from everyone involved, team members' interest in helping
 with the details of the project dropped considerably.
 Everyone in the project agrees that these challenging approaches have merit,
 but substantial disagreement regarding how much those merits are worth
 remains.
 All of the senior members of the team are truly excellent at non-blind
 measurements; it may have been a more-efficient use of everyone's time
 and resources to have proceeded down that path instead, even if that path
 is intrinsically biased toward zero.
 From an opposite viewpoint, the efficiencies of non-blind analysis become
 increasingly clear as a project nears completion, something to which a
 junior researcher can be blind.
 In either case, we failed to coalesce behind a single plan, to our considerable
 detriment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Upgrade plans
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a complete parallel-plate measurement under our belts, we're in a position
 to make important small upgrades.
 The biggest wins to be had are in modest improvements to the hardware,
 especially in tuning the contact potential.
 That single change has the potential to reduce both the largest source
 of statistical noise 
\bar under
and
\bar default
 the foil-coupling systematic.
 That single change, alongside easy improvements to the experiment's alignment,
 has the potential to produce a superior result within months.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Contact potential
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As noted in Sections 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Contact-potential-noise"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "par:Connection-to-contact"

\end_inset

, and elsewhere, our inability to set the contact voltage was the biggest
 single blocker for this measurement.
 The elevated electrical potential difference between the pendulum and the
 foil is probably responsible for the level of swing coupling we see, limits
 the distance of closest approach between the pendulum and the foil, and
 surely enhanced the pendulum/foil coupling that forced us to consider a
 systematic correction (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Subtraction-Foil"

\end_inset

).
 In addition, the presence of a possible foil/attractor contact potential
 may have led to the observable short-range attractor foil coupling that
 makes a pendulum/foil systematic correction so daunting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fix is clear.
 We have very nice fully-isolated battery-powered contact potential setting
 devices built and ready to go.
 We need only reconnect them, now that we understand that our systematic
 signal was due to the `capacitor systematic' and not something in the contact-p
otential system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Pendulum Battery
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we showed with Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Evidence-for-a-pendulum-battery"

\end_inset

, it is probable that the pendulum had its own trouble with an irreducible
 on-board battery, formed from the contact of the dissimilar metals of the
 pendulum body and the dense inlays.
 Alternatively, it is also possible that different regions of the foil surface
 held slightly different effective electrical potential.
 Either way, as measured, this voltage may have contributed 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim100$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

mV to the contact potential.
 A monolithic pendulum with a much-smaller area of closest approach, limited
 only to the active mass, may yield substantially better noise performance.
 If the dense/close side of the pendulum is sufficiently thick, it is also
 possible to imagine attaching a dense protruding 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

inlay
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to a lightweight pendulum body (perhaps glass or aluminum), minimizing
 the pendulum moment of inertia but still allowing complete control over
 the dense material/foil contact potential.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These approaches are 
\bar under
only
\bar default
 possible with the simultaneous use of a foil interferometer.
 The intentional loss of symmetry inherent to these designs requires that
 even more care be given to the foil's motion.
 While a tuned contact potential should limit the electrostatic effects
 of any swing, gas dynamics and other effects presently cancelled by approximate
 symmetries may become more pronounced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Pendulum flatness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our pendulum was a prototype, pressed into service when our superior pendulum
 failed.
 As seen in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:PendulumScans"

\end_inset

, a new pendulum could be made flatter with known fabrication techniques.
 We can surely get improved metrology, decreased separation, and improved
 active area with a flatter pendulum.
 A refined pendulum is likely to be implemented in parallel with the pendulum-ba
ttery reducing design mentioned above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Autocollimator
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Autocollimator-upgrades"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The autocollimator used in this iteration of the experiment was a coarse
 workhorse.
 The wide dynamic range, software-defined rotation, and two-dimensional
 operation were all quite useful to making this measurement possible.
 The noise floor of the autocollimator, however, wasn't too far away from
 the intrisic noise of the torsion balance.
 Improved readout would allow us to run higher-gain feedback loops, with
 larger differential terms.
 The stiffer loop performance would allow us to operate at shorter separations
 and at higher attractor frequencies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, the encoder systematic (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Encoder-narrative"

\end_inset

) most-likely emerged through electrical crosstalk between the autocollimator
 leads and the encoder.
 At present the leads that run between the photodiode and the autocollimator
 preamplifiers are 5-10
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

cm in length.
 By relocating the preamplifier board and improving the shielding further,
 we may be able to decrease the size of any encoder systematic.
 While it would require considerable testing to be trustworthy, the benefits
 of full-time encoder operation would be considerable.
 The attractor could operate in feedback, decreasing the positioning scatter
 by at least an order of magnitude, and there would be no need to use an
 air pressure gauge as a position monitor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
UV LED
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our understanding of exactly which physical mechanism increases the noise
 in the torsion pendulum at short pendulum/foil separation is minimal.
 One possiblity is that the pendulum is being buffeted by outgassing from
 the foil, perhaps enhanced by squeeze-film effects.
 Another is that adsorbed materials on the foil surface may be slowly rearrangin
g themselves, causing fluctuations of the effective electrostatic interactions
 between pendulum and foil.
 If either of these two are the culprit, as suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "PhysRevLett.109.103001WinelandGasNoise"

\end_inset

, it's possible that retracting the pendulum away from the foil and illuminating
 the active surfaces with ultraviolet light might improve the noise.
 Through photoelectric-like effects, UV light is known to significantly
 accelerate outgassing rates and expel adsorped surface layers.
 Trying out a UV light-emitting diode, as we've already used in our LISA
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 experiment, would be straightforward, and might yield an improvement in
 noise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Interferometer improvements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Interferometer-noise"

\end_inset

, the interferometer may be limited by polarization-related noise.
 If we were to switch to entirely polarization-maintaining fiber, it's possible
 that the pickup and drift we see could be reduced.
 We have begun to acquire the necessary fiber components to do so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, it would be a great help in simplifying the analysis and controllin
g for the foil systematic if we could hold the interferometer in its sensitive
 region of operation for the duration of the experiment.
 That could be accomplished by physically moving the interferometer fiber
 tip with slow-control feedback or by changing the laser temperature enough
 to shift the laser wavelength.
 The new infrared laser is extremely resistant to temperature change, which
 may force us to develop a mechanism of moving the fiber tip in a smooth
 and controllable fashion.
 The geared and levered-down servo that presently positions the fiber tip
 is too coarse for the job.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It has been suggested that we should replace the 90/10 coupler with a fiber
 circulator to increase the amount of light that reaches the detector by
 more than a factor of ten.
 Early experiments on tilt-meter interferometer test apparatus by Krishna
 Venkateswara suggest that a circulator will be a drop-in replacement for
 the existing coupler and will yield increased sensitivity.

Position choices
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Much of the difficulty in the data analysis stemmed from the use of a large
 ensemble of attractor positions instead of two or three.
 If we had instead chosed to operate with one or two position differences,
 the analyses of both systematic uncertainty and potential new physics would
 have been drastically simplified.
 The increased immunity to position-related systematic effects may not have
 been worth the massive cost in complexity.
 While blindness is still a challenge, it's equally possible to blind such
 a few-position measurement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Interleaved systematic studies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strategy of taking science data as quickly and comprehensively as possible
 and then following up with systematic studies was very pragmatic.
 Future measurements would benefit from interleaving systematic studies
 with science measurements (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "baron2014order"

\end_inset

 for a beautiful and extreme example).
 Each cut of science data could be immediately followed by repeating the
 cut with a varied systematic parameter (magnetic field, interferometer
 light power, attractor bias voltage, etc.).
 This isn't possible with all sources of systematic uncertainty (imposed
 temperature gradients take thousands of seconds to equilibrate), but it
 would relax the requirement that the instrument remain untouched and stable
 for months at a time.
 In addition, in-line systematic studies offer the opportunity to monitor
 the expected sensitivity of an entire measurement campaign in real time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Blindness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we have completed an entire measurement cycle with a blind measurement,
 we must revisit as a group whether or not a blind has been helpful.
 I contend that it has been essential to producing an unbiased result.
 Whether we choose to go blind for a second iteration or not is perhaps
 less important than whether we 
\bar under
agree
\bar default
 on whether we should.
 Whichever method we choose, we need to be all in it together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Python?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Octave has been a good and reliable tool throughout this work.
 While the Octave project continues to improve and work toward drop-in compatibi
lity with MATLAB, much of the open-source effort has moved into the SciPy
 packages for Python.
 Writing future analysis code in Python will make it more widely readable
 and permit access to mathematical libraries that are audited by many more
 users.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A particular sticking point is our reliance upon the excellent Gnuplot plotting
 package.
 Data often flows out of an Octave program, gets plotted in or analyzed
 a little in Gnuplot, and then is no longer accessible to the tools in Octave.
 At least a man-month has been spent finding ways to smoothly move data
 from one to the other and back.
 A search for a more integrated analysis and plotting environment will be
 worthwhile.

\begin_layout Standard
In this appendix we show, for completeness, the response of the global fitting
 algorithm to signals injected into the science data.
 Vertical/horizontal cross points are the location of injected signals,
 to show that we can recover Yukawa signals.
 These plots are of the same type as those described in Section
