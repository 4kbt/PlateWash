Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Four fundamental interactions are known to Physics.
 In historical order of characterization, they are gravity, which governs
 planetary motions; electromagnetism, which describes the interactions of
 electrically charged objects, and the weak force and strong forces, which
 govern nuclear and subnuclear dynamics.
 The electric and weak forces were unified theoretically by Glashow, Salam,
 and Weinberg as the electroweak interaction in 1967 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "GSWNobelPrize"

\end_inset

.
 The strong force is described well by quantum chromodynamics.
 The resulting theory of the electroweak and the strong, precisely tested,
 finely tuned, and quantum in nature, is known as the Standard Model.
 Einstein's theory of gravity, general relativity, is consistent with all
 precision tests, but it contains no known links to the Standard Model.
 For interactions with sufficiently high energy density, one or both theories
 must fail, as they predict different phenomena.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Standard Model is a triumph.
 It is a complex theory, with 18 or more parameters (particle masses, coupling
 constants, and mixing parameters) which are tuned to fit observation.
 After tuning, the Model has predictive power, correctly recovering within
 experimental and theoretical error the known zoo of observed particles,
 resonances, and phenomena, with very few exceptions.
 The exceptions are, therefore, very important.
 The Standard Model has one major remaining prediction - the existence of
 the so-called 'Higgs boson', a lynchpin for the theory, which may have
 been discovered at the LHC in 2012

 Furthermore, on a charge for charge basis, the interactions in the Standard
 Model are

 The theory of gravity, General Relativity, is well-tested and in agreement

 Furthermore, the mass and flavor eigenstates of the neutrino are not the

Newton proposed the gravitational inverse square law in 1687 in order to
 explain the motions of celestial bodies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 He suggested that the gravitational force between two objects is always
 attractive, is proportional to the mass of each object, and inversely proportio
nal to the square of the distance between them.
 This model was remarkably good at predicting the motion of celestial orbits,
 the tides, and gave the first quantitative estimate for the mass of the
 Earth.

The inverse square law (ISL) for gravity has been subjected to many experimental

 The observed stability of elliptical orbits and the apparent validity of
 Kepler's laws gave immediate support to the theory at solar system scales.

\begin_layout Subsection
String Theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
String theory provided the catalyst for a resurgence of interest in the
 inverse square law at sub-millimeter scales in the late 1990s.
 At the cost of as many as seven extra dimensions, the theory offers a promise
 of unifying gravity with the other forces.
 The extra dimensions are hidden away from normal observation with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compactification
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, introducing a lengthscale below which extra dimensions are relevant to
 particle interactions and above which any effects of extra dimensions are
 suppressed.
 Critically, the effects of gravity would be sensitive to the change in
 dimensionality by obeying Gauss' Law at all scales - diluting gravity into
 the many extra dimensions at short distances, while diluting into only
 three spatial dimensions at longer scales.
 This motivates the comparatively low strength of gravity in the three-dimension
al macroscopic world.
 String theories predict that gravity is significantly more attractive at
 scales shorter than the compactification scale.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If parametrized as a particle-exchange theory, string theory predicts two
 new types of exchange particles, known as the dilaton and the radion.
 Both would appear gravitationally as Yukawa violations of the inverse square
 law at scales comparable to the compactification length.
 The dilaton is responsible for the familiar Gauss' law increase in strength
 of gravity, while the radion is associated with excitations of the periodic
 spacetime normally accorded to the compactified dimensions.

In general, the compactification scales can be as small as the Planck scale,

 It was shown in 1998 by Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali that, using

 Because chameleon interactions are self-screening, the screening length

becomes the relevant length scale at which the new interaction may emerge

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to their physical motiviation, chameleon interactions are ready-made
 to evade traditional inverse square law tests.
 All precision tests of short-range gravity at gravitational strength to
 date, including our experiment, place a metal foil between the source and
 detector masses to suppress non-gravitational interactions.
 Because of the self-screening within materials the foil significantly diminishe
s the apparent strength of any chameleon interaction.
 When searching for chameleons, isolating shields must be made as thin and
 of as low a density material as possible, or dispensed with entirely.

 We know almost nothing about gravity on that scale.
 For every other known interaction of nature, our understanding reaches

Principle - Gauss' Law Test
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is easily shown that, in three dimensions, any force that obeys a 
\begin_inset Formula $1/r$
\end_inset

 potential satisfies Gauss' law 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-Gm\oiint_{S}\frac{\vec{r}}{|r|^{3}}\cdot d\hat{r}=-4\pi Gm.
\]

\end_inset

 The converse is true, too: If a force law satisfies Gauss' Law, then the
 field flux through a sphere centered on a point charge must be constant
 for all sphere radii.
 As the surface area of a three-dimensional sphere in three spatial dimensions
 is proportional to the square of its radius, then the field strength must
 fall as 
\begin_inset Formula $1/r^{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our experiment is a test of the uniformity of the gravitational field of
 an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

infinite
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sheet of mass.
 It is in this sense that our experiment is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Gauss' law test of gravity.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 For any force in three spatial dimensions, the field from an infinite two-dimen
sional sheet of charge must, by symmetry, be perpendicular to the plane
 of the sheet.
 Furthermore, if the interaction obeys Gauss' law, the flux of field remains
 constant with increasing distance from the sheet..
 Therefore, the strength of the interaction cannot vary with distance.
 This fact immediately suggests a simple test for whether an interaction
 follows Gauss' Law: Measure the force acting upon a test charge at two
 different distances from a sheet of charge.
 If the two measured forces are not equal, then the interaction does not
 obey Gauss' Law.
 Such an experiment is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

null-test
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for any deviation from an inverse square law.
 Colloquially, it might be referred to as a

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In idealized form, our experiment compares the gravitational field strength
 at two distances from an infinite sheet of mass.
 Finite sheet masses are suspended on opposite arms of a torsion pendulum.
 The sheet masses are aligned parallel to their moment arms, but displaced
 in opposite directions perpendicular to the arms (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Simple Parallel plate cartoon"

\end_inset

).
 If there is an inverse-square-law violating force between the sheets on
 the pendulum and an infinite sheet of matter, the pendulum will feel a
 torque.
 If the distance between the pendulum and the infinite sheet is modulated,
 the torque will vary in sync with the modulation.
 If there are no inverse-square law-violating interactions between the pendulum
 and sheet, the pendulum will experience 
\emph on
no torque change
\emph default
 as the infinite sheet is translated.
 The difficulties in the measurement primarily involve ensuring that the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

infinite sheet
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 approximation is valid and that gravity (and any new interaction) is the
 only messenger between the sheet and the pendulum.

The first line of defense against any non-gravitational interaction between
 the attractor and the pendulum is a tightly-stretched metal foil.
 It acts as a Faraday shield against electrostatic interaction, blocks all

 the attractor and pendulum.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The infinite-sheet attractor must become finite; the addition of a rim to
 the circular attractor can replace much of the gravitational forces that
 would be present with an infinite sheet.
 In this iteration of the experiment, the rim is too-large, leading to a
 small residual gravitational signal that is very linear in attractor position.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The pendulum is held in electrostatic feedback: the electrostatic interactions
 between the pendulum and the foil are far stronger than the torsion-fiber's
 stiffness, making feedback a necessity.
 The torque signal is extracted from the feedback loop.
 The signal strength is continuously calibrated using a separate rotating
 gravitational attractor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The attractor is moved toward and away from the pendulum in a square-wave
 pattern to avoid any velocity-dependent systematic effects.
 Groups of ten changes in position are lumped into a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 and used for further analysis.
 The experiment was operated with both per-cut randomized start/stop locations
 and continuous square-wave motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Great attention was paid to systematic effects.
 As any foil motion could lead to a parasitic signal, a Fizeau fiber interferome
ter was built to monitor the foil position.
 We believe that this is the first inverse-square-law measurement to have
 a dedicated foil monitor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For the primary goal of constraining Yukawa-like violations of the inverse
 square law, the data analysis makes a conservative choice to treat all
 systematic effects as Yukawa interactions, with independent interaction
 strengths and associated lengthscales.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
While the measurement was begun before blinding, the experimental analysis
 has been performed blind.
 Early in the process of developing the analysis, the true experimental
 results were accidentally viewed twice.
 Thus, the experiment cannot be regarded as truly blind, but it points the
 way to a future measurement.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In order to facilitate the unblinding of this complex analysis, and to guarantee
 future reproducibility, the entire analysis and the creation of this document
 is entirely automated.
 A collection of free software, the git repository, and the experimental
 data are all that are required to re-generate this result.

Angled plate torque
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice, the pendulum is not exactly parallel to the attractor.
 Furthermore, rotating one part of the pendulum toward the attractor can
 increase sensitivity.
 This analysis, like the flat plate calculations, neglects edge effects.
 This approximation underestimates the expected torque by an amount that
 depends on the angle, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, pendulum dimensions, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Foil-stretcher design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The design of the mechanism for stretching foils is important.
 The foil must be flat and tightly stretched.
 More recently, it has become clear that the foil surface must be easy to
 access and clean.
 In the past, our group has constructed foils by clamping beryllium-copper
 foils between strong aluminum rings while everything was submerged in liquid
 nitrogen.
 Upon warming to room temperature, the differential expansion of the aluminum
 rings brought the foil to high uniform tension.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The PlateWash foil stretcher is designed to provide good access to the front
 face of the foil and excellent flatness.
 It is constructed much like one would make a bongo drum; a clamping ring
 holds the foil at its perimeter, and a rounded-edge inner 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pusher
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that pushes on the back of the foil to bring it up to tension.
 Key to the success of this design is the rounded edge of the inner pusher.
 The radius of the edge must be large compared to the foil thickness in
 order to completely determine the state of the foil at the position of
 last contact.
 The radius of the edge should continue well past the point of last contact,
 to ensure a smooth transition, without any burrs or varying radial position
 of last contact.
 Furthermore, after turning, sanding, and polishing on the lathe, the pusher
 should be gently lapped, just for a moment, on a granite inspection plate
 to make the final height determination of the point of last contact.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to enable excellent access to the foil face, but preserve uniform
 tension in the foil, it is essential that the front ring of the foil clamping
 ring be very thin.
 In the case of PlateWash, with parallel fiber/foil alignment, the fiber
 is separated by only a millimeter from the foil face.
 The front clamping ring is only 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim1.2$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

mm thick.
 This allows the foil to remain nearly flat when being tensioned, requiring
 minimum slack in the foil to permit the foil pusher to come into tension
 while permitting full access to the foil face.
 In this iteration of the experiment, the front ring does not retreat behind
 the foil face, requiring a slight deflection of the fiber screw and inclination
 of the apparatus in order to clear the torsion fiber.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dimensions of everything in this instrument are partially-set by the
 availability of thin foils.
 We were unable to find strong metal foils of thickness

 The four photodiode signal currents were measured by transimpedance pre-amplifi

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tip and twist of the pendulum were computed in software.
 As in an analog readout, the angles were determined by taking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Diff/Sum
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 -- for each axis the difference between the left and right (up and down)
 channels was computed and divided by their sum.
 This standard procedure cancels the autocollimator's sensitivity to light
 intensity variations.
 Doing the computations in software allowed more-precise levelling of the
 twist axis signal than can be readily achieved in hardware, as any synthetic
 combination of the tip and twist angles can be trivially generated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, the autocollimator was operated with a software lock-in technique.
 The laser drive current was modulated at 500
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Hz, creating an approximately square-wave signal at the photodiode.
 The photodiode signal was digitized at 25
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

kHz.
 In each cycle of the laser drive current, 25 samples were recorded with
 the laser on, and 25 samples with the laser off.
 By taking the difference, we suppress the influence of any photodiode dark
 current.
 By averaging the locked-in signal, any interference at frequencies incommensura
te with the lock-in frequency is suppressed.

 It was worth every day (see

 A pneumatic actuation system is, by definition, not electrical.
 While the attractor flexure system was designed to accommodate standard
 micrometer actuators, if needed, the actuator is a phosphor-bronze bellows.
 The bellows is fed by a thin copper tube connected to a pressure-regulation
 positioned outside the vacuum chamber.
 When the system is taking science data, the position encoder for the flexure
 is a precision absolute pressure gauge outside the apparatus.
 The advantage to this arrangement is apparent when considering systematic
 uncertainties; by closing a valve between the apparatus and the pressure
 regulation/measurement system, it is possible to control for

 The

 is the equivalent of a lock on a pair of calipers; whatever air is present
 in the bellows when the valve is closed is trapped there, and the pressure/posi
tion is still measured continuously by the gauge.
 If there are no leaks and the absolute temperature (K) does not change,
 then the attractor can be held fixed in any position.
 As an additional capability, it will be seen that it can be useful for
 foil-interferometer calibration to have a controlled and very slow leak
 in the attractor drive system; the manual valves make this possible.

\begin_layout Standard
The gas-handling system was originally designed without the

, but it became critical to our success.
 We had intended to operate with the pulse-width modulation valve operating
 in continuous PID feedback to pressure or position sensors, this would
 have enabled fast position changes and excellent control over the attractor's
 position.
 Alas, the pulse-width modulation was still measurable and unacceptably
 large at the attractor -- attractor motion during measurement phases opens
 whole classes of systematic effects we do not wish to consider.
 The modulator could not be switched at higher frequencies, and any further
 passive low-pass filters would compromise the speed of our attractor motion.
 So, we fell back to open loop control of the modulator duty cycle and the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 pressure change is not desired.

 valves is essential.

The dominant 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

noise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the attractor position system comes from the pulse-width modulation
 system itself.
 The modulation valve and the locking valve are not coordinated at timescales
 comparable to the modulation frequency, so the locking valve shuts off
 in different parts of the modulation every time.
 Therefore, the attractor stops in a slightly different location on every
 move.
 This dominates the position scatter in attractor position for each 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 of data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On longer timescales, the fluctuation of atmospheric pressure is important.
 The precision regulator that feeds the gas handling system is referenced
 to atmospheric pressure.
 The attractor flexure, on the other hand, moves according to the pressure
 relative to vacuum.
 As the gas-handling system is nothing but a fancy pressure division device,
 the open-loop duty-cycle control of the modulation rides along the carrier
 of atmospheric pressure.
 This effect can be seen in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, where runs at constant duty cycle fluctuate slightly in absolute position.
 This effect limited how close we could reliably operate the attractor to

 through a 90/10 fiber coupler (ThorLabs FC1310-70-10-APC).
 The light that travels down the 90% branch is absorbed by an intensity

 The end of the fiber is carefully directed and positioned next to the isolating

 Approximately 4% of the light leaving the fiber is reflected from the glass/vac

In order for the intensity values measured at the photodiode to be meaningful,
 we must develop an intensity-change to displacement conversion.
 As the intensity at the output port varies sinusoidally with foil position,
 the sensitivity of the instrument is spatially-varying.
 With the initial visible-light laser, we attempted to lock the fringe phase
 into the location of maximum sensitivity by varying the laser temperature
 temperature, and hence frequency.
 With the infrared distributed-feedback laser, the temperature coefficient
 is so small that such an approach cannot work.
 Future versions of the experiment may include positioning feedback for
 the fiber mount in order to maximize sensitivity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Determining fringe contrast can be done by displacing the foil.
 The attractor can be pressed into the foil by lightly over-driving the
 translation stage.
 If valves are manipulated to permit a slow retreat of the attractor (or
 using the very slow leak of the isolation valve), a fringe pattern may
 be obtained, as in Fig.

As it is challenging to infer anything about foil motion near a fringe turning
 point, we don't.
 We only consider times when the interferometer was in the middle 71% (
\begin_inset Formula $\sin(\pi/4)=\sqrt{2}/2=0.707$
\end_inset

) of the range of fringe contrast, i.e.
 the range over which the interferometer output is approximately linear.
 Over the same range, the slope of the fringe-to-displacement sinusoid varies
 by at most 21% away from the mean (average slope 
\begin_inset Formula $2\sqrt{2}/\pi$
\end_inset

, maximum 1, minimum 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}/2$

 As we are only interested in an estimate (and hopefully an upper bound)
 on the foil's contribution to pendulum torque, this is sufficient.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 As the light emitted from the laser is, in general, polarized, the beamsplitter
 is likely to be polarization-sensitive, and the cavity and detector may
 have some polarization sensitivity, any change in polarization throughout
 the fibers may yield changing results.
 The effect of simply jostling the fiber is easily noted in the readout
 of the apparatus; listening to the photodiode output with headphones yields
 a siren-like tone, giving extra credence to the polarization-rotation explanati
on of the noise.
 Securing the fiber, where possible, to immovable objects with tape yielded
 a substantial improvement in sub-Hz noise.

With the introduction of the foil-positioning motors (see

 from outside the vacuum vessel.

 reduction ratio of ~10:1, shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

.
 Before pumping down, the fiber tip was translated far from the foil.
 After the foil and attractor were aligned, then the fiber tip was slowly
 brought toward the foil until fringes were observed.
 This must be done with care; going too far will puncture the foil with
 the fiber tip.
 The motorized approach is easier, faster, allows better fringe contrast,
 and damages fewer foils than aligning by hand.

Great care was exercised in the design of the data acquisition system.
 In order to prevent any correlation of attractor-related information with

 The computers shared only one ground, starred out from the main grounding
 block (see

 While the interferometer readout could have been done by the pendulum control
 computer, it was convenient to use a third computer, with its own data-acquisit

 The data were acquired from these three machines in parallel, each with
 their own clock.
 The timing system was arranged to synchronize all three computer clocks

 The up-down and left-right angles were recorded.

Once the attractor and foil were aligned, it was essential to remove any
 debris/dust in the gap between them.
 To characterize the amount of dust in the gap, and to verify alignment,
 the attractor-foil capacitance was measured as a function of attractor
 position, including positions where the attractor touched the foil.
 Touching was, at this step, determined by noting the position where the
 capacitance reading became unreliable.
 The maximum capacitance recorded without signs of touching gave a proxy
 for the minimum attractor-foil separation.

\begin_layout Standard
The attractor assembly was removed and the attractor face cleaned with isopropan
ol, clean room wipes, and dry nitrogen.
 The same was done with the attractor side of the foil.
 Both attractor and foil were visually inspected for dust.
 The attractor assembly was replaced against the registry blocks and re-clamped.
 The attractor-foil capacitance was measured as a function of attractor
 position.
 The cleaning procedure was repeated until no gains in capacitance were
 observed with subsequent cleanings.

The critical distances between and relative orientations of the pendulum,

 A number of methods were explored, but the method of choice was as follows:
 The freely twisting pendulum was allowed to tap the foil as the attractor
 was pressed into the foil by the flexure stage.
 As the attractor displaced the foil, the angular amplitude of the tapping
 signal necessarily decreased to zero.
 The point where this occurred was used as a reference to determine the
 absolute distance between the pendulum and the attractor

 Microscopically, there is only one form of gas damping - collisions between
 gas particles and an oscillator allow momentum and energy exchange.
 Experimentally, when the particle mean free path is larger than the dimensions
 of the chamber, gas damping appears in two forms: 'free' damping and 'proximity

 Free gas damping is independent of an oscillator's location in a vacuum
 chamber, and depends only upon properties of the gas and the dimensions
 of the pendulum.

The influence of any contact-potential noise, either through direct fluctuation

 The force acting between plates of a parallel-plate capacitor with area

\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$

\begin_inset Formula $|F|=\epsilon_{0}A\frac{V_{0}^{2}}{d^{2}}$

 For small variations in voltage (
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}\rightarrow V_{0}+\delta v)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $|F|=\epsilon_{0}\frac{A}{d^{2}}(V_{0}^{2}+2V_{0}\delta V+(\delta V)^{2})$
\end_inset

 Thus, nulling 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 can minimize the effect of any voltage fluctuation.
 Similarly, for swing, where 
\begin_inset Formula $d\rightarrow d_{0}+\delta d$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $|F|=\epsilon_{0}\frac{AV_{0}^{2}}{(d_{0}+\delta d)^{2}}$

 We carefully designed battery-powered isolated and remotely-operable power
 supplies to permit the nulling of 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$

Furthermore, the presence of an uncompensated contact potential acts as
 an anti-spring for the pendulum, pulling the torsion pendulum asymptotically
 away from its zero position.
 As the pendulum twists away from a parallel orientation with respect to
 the foil, the 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}^{2}/d^{2}$
\end_inset

 nature of the capacitive force pulls even harder.
 Once the capacitive torque is greater than the torsion fiber restoring
 torque, the pendulum runs away toward the foil.
 As our sensitivity to new physics increases exponentially with smaller
 pendulum/foil separation, we are driven to operate the pendulum at the
 smallest distance at which we can preserve stable operation of the pendulum.
 Compensation of the contact potential allows us to operate with lower noise
 at closer distances.

There are several ways in which ground motion can cause an apparent pendulum

Rotation of the ground: This rotates the instrument relative to the pendulum
 and appears as a spurious torque.
 In practice, this effect is much smaller than other noise sources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
'Tilt feedthrough': Asymmetry in the fiber cross-section converts the tilt
 of the fiber support into a pendulum twist.
 This is suppressed, but not eliminated, by the fiber 'prehanger'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Magnetic damper asymmetry: If the field of the swing damper is inhomogeneous,
 and the prehanger mass has a magnetic moment, damper swing will be converted
 to a torque.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Vertical bouncing: up-down motion of the pendulum changes the tensile stress
 in the fiber.
 There is a connection between fiber stress and equilibrium position, so
 vertical shaking may give rise to apparent torques.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Electrostatic interaction with nearby surfaces: For PlateWash, and most
 short-range experiments, this is the dominant effect.
 Asymmetric position-dependent pendulum interactions with the foil, control
 electrodes, and nearby grounded surfaces easily create powerful torques
 on the pendulum.
 Careful minimization of contact potentials is essential to reduce tilt/swing
 couplings.

While the coupling mechanism to wind is related to some combination of seismic

 What is clear from our data is a strong coupling between outside wind and

 Stormy periods can elevate torque noise by as much as an order of magnitude
 over completely still periods.

Connection to contact potential
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As elucidated above, the electrostatic environment near the pendulum is
 important to these vibrational noise sources.
 The largest and closest surface to the pendulum is the foil.
 Minimizing the pendulum-foil contact potential, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{PF}$
\end_inset

, can have considerable impact on pendulum noise.
 Because of a non-constant contact potential as a function of pendulum angle,
 we were unable to trim 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{PF}$
\end_inset

 as well as should be possible in principle.
 Furthermore, as seen in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Capacitor-Systematic"

\end_inset

, we chose to give up control of 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{PF}$
\end_inset

 in order to eliminate a possible systematic effect.
 With further investigation, the systematic was traced to a bypass capacitor.
 Direct grounding of the foil is no longer required, and we will re-enable
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{PF}$

 control.
 Future pendulum designs and future iterations of this experiment must minimize

Temperature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The PlateWash apparatus is sensitive to temperature.
 The fiber's equilibrium position and drift rate are perhaps most temperature
 dependent, but there are many temperature sensitive elements in the apparatus.
 To limit the effects of temperature variation, the instrument is located
 in a temperature controlled room.
 The room temperature varies by less than 1 degree through the year and
 <0.2 degrees daily.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As passive isolation, the vacuum system is an excellent insulator, with
 a time constant of about a week XXXMA for the internal aluminum baseplate
 with respect to the outside world.
 As further, rather limited, insulation, the clean-room fans are turned
 off during measurement periods, trapping a volume of air around the apparatus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Instrumental noise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many electronic effects can create excess noise.
 Most pick-up effects are indistinguishable from autocollimator noise.
 Because PlateWash normally operates in electrostatic feedback, there is
 a second channel through which EMF pickup, ground loops, and finite digital-to-
analog conversion noise can couple to the pendulum.
 These effects may be assessed by comparing the pendulum noise with and
 without the feedback electrodes grounded.
 No excess noise was seen.

Electronic/Instrumental Crosstalk
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any effect that is not directly related to attractor motion, but is aware
 of attractor position, lands in this catchall category.
 In general, these systematics are very important in many experiments.
 In this case, the experiment includes an isolation valve on the air pressure
 line to the attractor bellows.
 The valve is positioned downstream of the electronic pressure gauge.
 The valve may be closed, and 
\bar under
every
\bar default
 electrical signal associated with the operation of the experiment is unchanged.
 The data analysis system is also unchanged, making it possible to test
 for these systematics directly.
 This ability is the greatest strength of the pneumatic drive system; any
 electrically-actuated drive cannot separate electrical crosstalk in this
 way.

Attractor-foil contact potential
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The attractor and foil will, in general, have different values of electrical
 potential.
 The electrical connections between them will include a collection of Galvanic-p
otential generating junctions.
 The voltages generated at each junction are, as in a thermocouple, temperature-
dependent and may depend upon the detailed structure of the junction, leading
 to temperature sensitivity, temperature-gradient sensitivity, changes with
 mechanical creep, and perhaps microphonic pickup.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be safe from the effects attractor-correlated contact potential variation,
 the pendulum/foil contact potential cannot change by more than 1-10 nV
 in an attractor-correlated way.
 This voltage is hard to measure in any way but with a torsion balance,
 as the effective output impedance of any contact-potential generating phenomeno
n will be large (cannot drive much current), and the input impedance of
 the torsion balance as a voltmeter is very small (with the LISA test apparatus,
 we measured T

 resistances of a quartz fiber).
 In defense of the experiment, no part of the moving attractor assembly
 is in contact with the pendulum or foil support structures.
 If an effect were to appear, it would most-probably be generated by somehow
 displacing the wires that connect the foil and pendulum to ground, or by

As the attractor does not have the spatial extent of an infinite sheet,
 the gravitational field of the attractor has both distance and misalignment
 dependence.
 To estimate the size of this effect, two independent mass-integration programs
 were written.
 When completed, it was discovered that one trivial bug separated the two
 codes from nearly exact agreement.
 See Chapter

 As expected from flat surfaces in the near field, the torque vs.
 distance curves are predominantly linear.
 For a properly centered pendulum, the expected torque per unit attractor

Small non-uniformities in density of the attractor or pendulum materials
 can mimic or mask a signal.
 The flat plate geometry of the experiment renders this effect largely second
 order.
 In the absence of an attractor non-uniformity, a pendulum void should be
 expected to have no effect at all.
 In the absence of a pendulum non-uniformity, an attractor void will cause
 a lateral position-dependent torque.
 If the attractor void were to occur near the outer corner of the dense

Horizontal displacement of the pendulum is an excellent potential test for

\begin_layout Standard
One interesting systematic effect that can exhibit considerable nonlinearity
 is the nonlinearity of the flexure itself.
 Most tilt-related effects are essentially blind to the attractor-foil distance.
 In order to maximise our use of the flexure's limited (<2mm) travel, the
 flexure's internal travel limit was located not far from the point at which
 the attractor pressed hard into the foil.
 If the double-compensating mechanism of the flexure experiences nonlinear
 stress near the (artificially-placed with mechanical stops) end of its
 travel, nonlinear stresses might be communicated to the baseplate.
 By looking at the nonlinearity of the vertical axis of the pendulum output,
 we can constrain the nonlinearity to XXXRC, yielding a torque of XXXRC.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Magnetism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Magnetic systematics are among the most difficult to assess in these experiments.
 The foil provides limited, if any, shielding against low frequency magnetic
 fields.
 Because of the considerable strength of the magnetic interaction, great
 care must be taken to ensure that magnetic effects do not mimic or mask
 a gravitational signal.
 For the shortest-range effects, the torsion balance may be the most sensitive
 probe for their existence, complicating things considerably.
 Short range gravity research is becoming increasingly sophisticated in
 this realm; previous tests have only considered some of these effects.

Metrology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Understanding the separation between attractor and test masses is essential
 to any inverse square law test.
 However, because of the nearly-null parallel-plate geometry, the implications
 of an accidental error in metrology affect only the stated exclusion limits,
 but not the presence nor absence of a purported ISL violation.
 This is an important contrast to non-null experiments, where an error in
 attractor/sensor separation alone can lead to a faked or masked signal
 for new physics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For PlateWash, the metrology is relatively straightforward.
 We must ascertain the extent to which the pendulum and attractor are parallel
 and obtain an estimate of their relative separation.
 As in most inverse-square law tests, this is confounded by the isolating
 foil stretched between them.
 As the foil is quite flat (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Isolating-Foil"

\end_inset

), we break the problem in half, measuring the attractor-foil separation
 and the pendulum-foil separation.

The most-challenging metrology was on the pendulum side of the foil.

) and vertical (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 of the foil.
 After the foil was installed and aligned, both the pendulum position (

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to visual access to the pendulum's separation from the foil,
 we installed a mirror that allows us to compare the horizontal (left/right)
 position of the torsion fiber to a ruled grating on the foil-stretcher.
 When the experiment is initially aligned, the fiber is centered on the
 top of the attractor, where 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

top
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is denoted as farthest from the plane of the optical bench.
 The pendulum is translated attractor-axially away from the attractor, and
 the foil is installed.
 After the foil is fully aligned, but the fiber has not yet been translated
 horizontally, the pendulum is again brought near the foil, and the location
 of the fiber on the foil-stretcher's ruled grating is photographed via
 the viewport and the dedicated mirror.
 Once this is complete, then any horizontal translation of the fiber can
 easily be compared with this reference position in order to determine the
 horizontal position of the pendulum with respect to the top of the attractor.

 This entire set of measurements was done with a substantial horizontal
 position offset; the pendulum had been displaced horizontally in runs prior
 to the beginning of the science data in an effort to understand a systematic
 ISL-violating signal that would later be traced to the bypass capacitors

The thickness of the foil was determined by making many micrometer measurements

 Touching the foil, particularly with a hard/sharp-cornered object like
 a micrometer can easily damage the foil by denting it.
 Even a piece of dust, compressed between the micrometer jaw and the foil,
 can be sufficient to dimple the foil and increase its effective thickness.
 For this reason, we have not directly measured the actual foil's thickness.
 If the foil thickness measurement were to become of increased concern,
 we could destructively test it.

Readout Noise

\begin_layout Standard
No physical measurement has arbitrary precision; we must consider the effects
 of finite-precision angle readout on our ability to measure torque.
 For simplicity, let our angle noise at all frequencies be 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\theta$
\end_inset

 (a practical approximation, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Autocollimator noise"

\end_inset

).
 Our minimum resolvable torque signal at any given frequency is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta\tau(\omega)=\frac{\delta\theta}{T(\omega)}=\kappa\sqrt{(1-\omega^{2}/\omega_{0}^{2})^{2}+1/Q^{2}}\delta\theta\approx\kappa\left|1-\omega^{2}/\omega_{0}^{2}\right|\delta\theta

As described in

 In our frequency range of interest, it appears as relatively frequency-independ

 Some of this noise is time-dependent, correlated with wind, human activity,
 and worldwide seismic activity.

A second benefit to small

 This experiment relies on Monte Carlo-like measurement schemes (random

 constrain possible violations of the ISL.
 Faster individual measurements allow faster exploration of parameter space
 (exploring a

Choosing a frequency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the first harmonic is the only signal of importance (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Harmonics"

\end_inset

), we should place the first harmonic at the location of lowest noise (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Experimentally-determined-noise"

\end_inset

).
 Furthermore, we are driven by statistics (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Statistics"

\end_inset

) to operate at the highest practical frequency.
 The required use of dead times to eliminate systematic uncertainties places
 a soft upper bound on usable frequencies (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Lags"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The operating frequency was chosen well in advance of the science run reported
 here, before the instrument was fully understood.
 We selected a frequency that we expected would give low noise and was sufficien
tly slow to allow transients associated with attractor motion to damp.
 We selected 3.90625
\begin_inset space ~

 This choice improves the performance of discrete Fourier analysis and minimizes
 beating between signal and sample frequencies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Choosing a science signal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the pendulum is locked in feedback, there are multiple data channels
 that may be used to extract a science measurement.
 The pendulum twist angle, the feedback signal itself, and the P, I, and
 D terms of the feedback loop are written to disk.
 The pendulum twist angle and the P (proportional) term of the loop are
 equivalent.
 In practice, the twist signal and P term were anti-aliased differently.
 The P term had an 5
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s filter applied, making it the signal of choice for a twist measurement.
 The loop was operated with zero I-term, so the I channel contains no signal.
 The D (derivative) term responds like 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

, making it unsuited to low frequency signal extraction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, there are two reasonable science channels: the feedback signal applied
 to the pendulum, and the P term.
 The feedback signal has units of torque, the P term has units of angle.
 Even though the pendulum is held fixed, the torque-angle transfer function
 remains important.
 At frequencies below the resonance of the pendulum, the two channels are
 directly proportional.
 At frequencies above resonance, the frequency-independent angle noise of
 the autocollimator appears, in the feedback signal, as torque noise that
 rises like frequency squared.
 As shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Fourier Harmonics"

\end_inset

, the higher harmonics of the attractor motion contain no interesting signal,
 so it is in our interest to low-pass them away.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By choosing the angle/P-term signal instead of the feedback signal as the
 science signal, we use the inertia of the pendulum as an analog low-pass
 filter.
 While, in principle, both signals contain the science, the science signal
 is more-easily extracted from the angle signal.
 Furthermore, as the feedback signal is the sum of the P and the derived
 D terms, there's less opportunity for an error to enter into the science
 signal if the measured angle is used alone.

 is the use of random attractor locations This approach trades away some
 signal-to-noise in return for improved defense against systematic effects.
 Instead of focusing exclusively upon a small set of start and end locations
 for the attractor, we considered a large distribution of them.
 This method has the potential to expose important systematic curiosities,
 like the one described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Encoder-narrative"

\end_inset

, and has the added advantage of allowing a more-complete measurement of
 the distance-dependence of any measured force.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The random locations were generated by random number generator into configuratio
n files for the attractor computer to run.
 This enables systematic tests that repeat the attractor positions used
 in science runs.
 The distribution of random attractor locations used was the simplest, and
 perhaps least efficient, uniform distributions of start and end positions.
 This spends perhaps more time than is warranted exploring shorter attractor-pos
ition differences.

\begin_layout Standard
The determination of which attractor positions were used was done by evaluating
 the expected sensitivity of the aggregate science measurement.
 As the statistical noise fluctuates significantly on a day-to-day basis,
 it was impossible to predict precisely the performance of the apparatus.
 A few reliable measurements during conditions of comparatively low noise
 can carry more statistical power than a day's worth of measurements in
 noisy conditions.
 As we used our blinded sensitivity for guidance, we are confident that
 we have not biased our experimental outcome by tuning into any particular
 central value.
 In practice, this guidance led us to switch from predominantly

 runs to a focused square-wave approach late in the science run in an effort
 to improve the shortest range at which we could reach gravitational strength.

 Some runs preceding 3234 had the interferometer laser turned off; more
 archaeology awaits to determine if an interferometer-heating test can be
 used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the future, interleaving systematics tests with science runs would be
 more satisfactory.
 With the exception of thermal tests, which have long time constants, it's
 possible to do a science measurement, magnetic tests, interferometer on/off
 tests, and electrical bias tests programatically with each attractor setting,
 merging them into a single super-block of measurements that comprise a
 self-contained ISL test for one attractor position pair.
 The ability to make incremental/aggregated ISL tests may be worth the added
 programming complexity.

 This section provides a chronological narrative.
 The data analysis is functionally run twice, once using only the pendulum

 As detailed in

Source data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data used in the analysis come from two sources, those that we determined
 externally and hand-entered and those sourced directly from the data acquisitio
n systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
External inputs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Externally-applied systematic injections and environmental variables (temperatur
e, magnetic field, etc.), were determined by hand (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) or in separate analyses (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) on a run-by-run basis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, all experimental parameters (alignment, dimensions, densities,
 analysis parameters, etc.) are stored in global configuration files that
 are read by any process that needs them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Data files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each data-acquisition computer generates its own data files.
 When the pendulum computer's data are read, externally-measured data are
 joined to the raw output from the pendulum DAQ.
 The timing data are then referenced to a common datum (January 1, 2009).

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Filtering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Filtering"

\end_inset

, the data are passed through FIR filters, primarily to notch out the gravitatio
nal calibration signal and to bandpass away drift in the pendulum.
 All other channels to be analyzed alongside the torque data are passed
 through a largely-inconsequential, but equal duration, filter in order
 to phase-match them to the torque signal.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Calibration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In

 with the filtering step, the torque data are calibrated using the gravitational
 calibration injection, as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 The calibration takes the form of a multiplicative constant, applied to
 the torque data in the

Lock-in
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The attractor moves in an 
\begin_inset Formula $ABABABABABABABABABAB$
\end_inset

 fashion.
 Before measuring the differences between state 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and state 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, it is necessary to phase-match the analysis to the phase of the attractor
 motion, as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Edge-finding"

\end_inset

.
 The code finds rising edges in the attractor data and uses them to find
 the steps in the data.
 Using these steps, the code then projects, open-loop, the temporal location
 of all the steps in the dataset.
 Each step is then measured, using the dead-times projected in

 of ten attractor periods, after which the attractor's

\end_inset

 positions may change.
 The code parses the data into these cuts, as referenced from the starting
 location (up to an attractor half-period, runs must begin in-phase with
 a cut).
 The first 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and

 states are dropped from the cut before the aggregate properties of the

\end_inset

\begin_layout Subsection
Interpretation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that the data are measured, what do they say? As the foil systematic
 is important, we proceed first to ascertain the size of any necessary correctio
n due to foil motion.
 We then fit for the presence of any Yukawa signal.
 In addition, we perform an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

arbitrary fit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which is a model-free approach to characterizing our measured signal,
 with less attention to systematic uncertainty.
 Finally, as a limited cross-check on some analysis, we also compute a Yukawa
 fit by an independent method, without attention to systematics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Interferometer branch
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the isolating foil moves in an attractor-correlated way, we need to know
 how much influence it may have on the pendulum.
 The optimal approach would have the foil interferometer running continuously
 and in-range; it would then be possible to add a joint fit for the foil-motion-
to-torque constant to the global fit for new physics.
 As we only had partial coverage with the interferometer (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "par:A-conservative-approach"

\end_inset

), model-building is required.
\end_layout

Interferometer foil-motion to torque constant
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As detailed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Pendulum-Foil-coupling"

\end_inset

, we displaced the attractor into contact with the foil and measured the
 attractor-displacement to torque transfer function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Attractor position to foil motion fit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As detailed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Data/Fit"

\end_inset

, we use the data from times that the interferometer was in-range to generate
 a piecewise-linear model of the foil displacement as a function of attractor
 position.
 The fit is bootstrapped, allowing insight into the uncertainty in the extracted
 fit parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Foil-driven torque vs foil position model/correction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By combining the foil-motion to torque calibration with the foil displacement
 as a function of attractor position, we construct a foil-motion-related
 torque correction as a function of attractor position which can be applied
 to the entire dataset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Yukawa fit with systematics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As detailed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Model-Comparison"

\end_inset

, the science signal and estimates for the magnitude of systematic effects
 are fit jointly.
 This bootstrapped fitting approach yields a distribution of best-fits in
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha-\lambda$
\end_inset

 space.
 The many bootstrapped fits of the attractor-driven foil motion torque correctio
n are individually applied to these fits, allowing direct propagation of
 the correction uncertainty into the final fit results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Confidence intervals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many ways to draw two-dimensional confidence intervals from a
 distribution of best-fit points.
 We have not yet settled on one.
 The Committee is strongly encouraged to make their voices known as to how
 they'd like to see this done.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just as for the foil displacement as a function of attractor position, we
 make a model-free fit for the pendulum torque as a function of attractor
 position.
 Furthermore, by subtracting the foil-motion torque correction from this
 fit, we are able to compensate for the foil-motion systematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Uncorrected Yukawa fit without systematics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a cross-check on the Yukawa fitter, we additionally produce best-fit
 results from an earlier generation of the fit programs.

 (XXXRC Jens wants a kappa errorbar) The time variation of the calibration
 signal is most-probably understood as slow drifts in the pendulum/foil/electrod

 It is also possible that some of the electronics involved in the feedback

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Calibration Systematics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible that the calibration torque has a non-gravitational component.
 We do not expect that such an effect is of great concern for this measurement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As originally-designed, the calibration system had a magnetic-relay 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cycle-mark
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which would allow us to constrain the phase of the rotating attractor's
 motion.
 Both because the cycle mark had reliability trouble and because the rotating
 magnet and associated electrical signals could inject a false signal of
 its own, the cycle mark system was disabled, and the rotating magnet removed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The largest possible systematic signals (tilt and direct magnetic coupling
 to the pendulum magnetic moment) should appear at the rotating attractor's
 1-
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 frequency, not the critical 2-
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 gravitational signal frequency.
 While a clear 1-
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 signal would occasionally appear, it was inconsistent and often absent;
 the 2-
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 calibration signal was far more consistent in fractional amplitude (see
 Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Gravitational-calibration"

\end_inset

).
 While a 2-
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 signal is a possibility, perhaps through modulation of the background magnetic
 field, the acoustic environment (an acoustic modulation was seen in acousticall
y-driven studies of the foil interferometer), or the thermal environment,
 any of these effects should be small.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most-importantly, as this is a null experiment, with no absolute gravitational
 subtraction required, the calibration line is used primarily to set the
 torque scale and to show that the torque scale remains approximately stable
 throughout the experiment.
 For this reason, systematics on the calibration signal are not of grave
 concern.

\begin_layout Standard
With three data acquisition computers running simultaneously, relative timing
 is important.
 As designed, the three computers would resynchronize their clocks with
 an external reference every 3141 seconds.
 The computer clocks' relative drift rates are less than 10
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s/day, so continuous resynchronization would yield overall synchronization
 at better than the 1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s level at all times.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice, it was observed that the resynchronization system would fail
 intermittently, making a hand accounting of known clock changes necessary.
 In the two runs where the attractor touches the foil, we have synchronous
 signals in all three computers, allowing some cross-checking of the accounting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further complicating the synchronization effort is the fact that for the
 torsion-balance and attractor computers, the data-acquisition system sample
 rate is controlled by the data-acquisition card's clock, and not the computer
 clock.

Windowing is familiar to many as a method for reducing the magnitude of
 spectral leakage in Fourier transforms.
 It is also of use, as a low-pass filter, in reducing the sensitivity of
 an averaged value to high frequency fluctuations at a modest expense in
 statistical resolving power.
 In this analysis, a Hann window is used

 Just as in periodogram estimation, the choice

Once the dead times are chosen, a window selected, and a leading edge found,
 locking in is straightforward.
 Beginning at a time prescribed by a leading edge, the analysis program
 walks through each data stream, multiplies the data found in each 'step
 period' (1/2 the attractor motion period) by the properly-delayed window
 function, and computes the weighted average.
 The resulting average forms a single measurement.

The first measurement, and every other subsequent measurement, is regarded

 The second measurement, and every other subsequent measurement (the complement

 Because the pneumatic drive takes about one attractor period to come into
 equilibrium (if coming from a different A/B position pair in the previous
 cut), the first A and B measurements are dropped from quantitative analysis.

 The filters are designed by the octave-forge function 'fir1'.
 The torsion balance feedback signal is sent through a filter whose parameters
 are described in fir1 syntax as [0.001,0.0045,0.005,0.009,0.010,0.05].

Torque Calibration

While the torque scale is ultimately hardcoded with the value set in

 The analysis routine is designed to fit and subtract both the 1-
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 and 2-
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 signals from the attractor.
 The fitting algorithm implements a binary search in frequency for the maximum
 fit amplitude present in the data.
 At present, there is no cycle-mark on the calibration attractor, so no
 attempt is made to match the phase of the fit with an external phase reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To remove transients before fitting, torque data are passed through a 'spikeRemo
ver', applied to the data's time derivative.
 As the calibration signal is continuous, transient signals are interpreted
 as spurious.
 Any 100 s region of data centered on a suspected spike is excised completely.
 Spike detection uses a an aggressive version of Chauvenet's criterion XXY
 (ref).
 XXY (Peirce's criteron may actually be better for this?) The implementation
 loops 20 iterations of the spike removing code to ensure that spikes of
 multiple scales (or spikes sufficiently numerous to pull the initial standard

Preventing the aliasing of high frequency noise into low frequency measurements
 is of particular importance to the PlateWash measurement.
 As the torsion balance operates in feedback, autocollimator noise, (white
 in angle), rises like 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{2}$
\end_inset

 in torque.
 As an simple anti-aliasing measure, the data within each accepted bin are
 multiplied by a parabolic (Welch) window function before averaging.
 To preserve normalization, the weights are independently accumulated, and
 the ratio of accumulated weighted data to accumulated weight is the reported
 average for each bin.

A clear method of visualization is important to understanding the output
 of any experiment.
 For PlateWash, the natural plot is three-dimensional.
 The experiment measures the difference in pendulum torque between two different
 attractor positions.
 So, if we plot 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau(\mbox{start},\mbox{end})$
\end_inset

, we can plot every measurement in the experiment in a single plot, as in
 Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "TriangleScatterPlot"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three dimensional plots are difficult to read, three dimensional plots with
 errorbars are worse.
 Furthermore, the scatter in a plot like Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "TriangleScatterPlot"

\end_inset

 is dominated by the noisiest points.
 As shown in (plot of noise vs.
 time), the noise in PlateWash varies by orders of magnitude with environmental
 conditions; we're interested mostly in the points with least scatter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to present the result in a meaningful and two-dimensional way,
 the 'triangle plot' was developed.
 In order to improve the statistics by a factor of two, we make the assumption
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau(a,b)=\Delta\tau(b,a)$
\end_inset

, and fold the points over the 
\begin_inset Formula $a=b$
\end_inset

 axis.
 In order to plot points with uncertainties, measurements are plotted as
 circles in the 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b$
\end_inset

 plane.
 The magnitude of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

 is represented by the radius of the circle.
 To provide an errorbar, the region from 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau+\sigma_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau-\sigma_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 is plotted in grey.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau-\sigma_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $|\Delta\tau+\sigma_{\tau}|$
\end_inset

 are greater than zero (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 a point is off-zero with 1-
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 significance), the remainder of the circle is filled in with color.
 To represent the sign of the datapoint, yellow is negative, and blue is
 positive XXXRC (check sign).
 Any force of nature should satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau(a,a)=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 Any conservative force should be associative: 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau(a,c)=\Delta\tau(a,b)+\Delta\tau(b,c)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This method has limitations.
 Large signals, or large uncertainties produce large circles, which can
 hide smaller, more significant, points.
 For sparsely sampled data, however, it can be very helpful.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Bootstrap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis presented here makes extensive use of a statistical method
 called 'the bootstrap' or 'bootstrapping'.
 Its primary merit in this context is that it allows straightforward and
 reasonably robust estimation of confidence intervals.
 Its support rests upon the premise that the best estimator for the distribution
 from which a data set is drawn is the data set itself.
 The idea is to 'resample' the data to create synthetic data sets which
 may be passed through any analysis routine developed for the original data
 set.
 With repetition, this process generates distributions of important output
 quantities (best-fit points in 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha-\lambda$
\end_inset

 space, for example) without recourse to complex error estimation/propagation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resampling scheme used in this analysis was to generate synthetic data
 sets of the same size as the original set by randomly selecting measurements
 (there are always duplicate picks, except in the special case where the
 original data are recovered, out of order) from the initial data set.
 There is a related class of methods called 'the jackknife' that generate
 statistics by considering complete sets of subsets of data, perhaps by
 dividing the initial data into subsets, fitting each subset, and drawing
 statistics from the fit outputs.
 The jackknife may more readily accepted by those uncomfortable with the
 bootstrap; in the case of this measurement, there are too few measurements
 to allow meaningful statistics to be drawn from the fit outputs.
 Halving or quartering the dataset could be possible, but cutting it into
 ten pieces would result in too-little coverage in terms of varied attractor
 displacements

The bootstrap makes comparison with any proposed model straightforward.
 No matter how exotic the fitting function and how sensitive it may be to
 individual datapoints or non-Gaussianity in the initial data, it is straightfor
ward to bootstrap the data, fit, bootstrap again, fit, etc...
 The distribution of fit outcomes can always be studied, and qualitative
 understanding is immediate.
 Settling on an algorithm for generating confidence intervals is, however,
 more difficult, especially in multi-parameter spaces.

Goodness-of-fit,

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A weakness of bootstrapped analysis is its reliance upon computational power
 to produce useful results.
 If the dimension of a problem gets too high, it is difficult to ensure
 that fitting parameter spaces are well-explored.
 It is possible to include systematic effects into bootstrapped confidence
 intervals by modelling each systematic and injecting the expected amount
 of noise into the data to be fitted.
 If little is known about the systematic effect, however, this approach
 is a challenge.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is more-reliable to attempt to include poorly-known systematics into
 the fit, fitting over all the data, including the systematic tests.
 This is done here by ascribing a new fictitious force to each systematic,
 parametrized conservatively as a Yukawa torque, with its own strength and
 lengthscale.
 Furthermore, if we're able to compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 directly, there is a well-accepted approach to the determination of confidence
 intervals and exclusion limits.

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1$

 is taken to be the gravity/science signal (

\end_inset

 correspond to externally-modified systematic parameters, each with associated

 position is determined, the experimental sensitivity should be degraded.
 In the linearization approach, this corresponds to a diverging 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\sigma}_{f}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, linearizing 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-x/\lambda}$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{x}\gtrsim\lambda$
\end_inset

 is a recipe for trouble.
 With the aid and inspiration of Jason Detwiler, we computed the full non-linear
 variance of

 (the

 is worth a look).
 While we succeded, this entire approach has a fatal flaw; the flaw is in

The flaw is easy to see qualitatively.
 In Equation

\end_inset

, when 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{G}^{2}$
\end_inset

 diverges, 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 is driven to zero.
 Any 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

-minimizing fitter will, given the opportunity, exploit this to favor locations
 in which 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{G}^{2}$
\end_inset

 is huge.
 Thus, fits with smaller 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 are incorrectly preferred over perfectly reasonable fits with larger 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 Nikolai Tolich was the first of anyone with whom we spoke to reach a quantitati

\begin_layout Standard
Without a rigorous way to use 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 in a way that bakes in uncertainties of dependent variables, we cannot
 use it to pull out meaningful confidence intervals.
 So, we return to the simple land of Monte Carlo tricks.
 We'll keep the linearized variance approach for the 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{i}$
\end_inset

, as it's appropriate there, but we'll resort to Monte Carlo to determine
 the effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{x}$
\end_inset

 uncertainties.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To do so, we will bootstrap the torque data, generating a synthetic data
 set.
 When we do, we will

fuzz
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the measured 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{B}$
\end_inset

 positions by a normally-distributed amount determined by each measurement's
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{x_{A}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{x_{B}}$
\end_inset

.
 This fuzzing process, in concert with the bootstrapping of the torque data,
 should distribute the best-fit points as expected from a more-sophisticated
 approach to error analysis.
 Making this choice tables for later the considerable problem of confidence-inte
rval determination.

Blindness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most accurate experiments are free of bias.
 It is possible to perform an unbiased experiment without a blind, but it
 is difficult to guarantee that all pre-concieved notions of experimental
 results and implications are suppressed.
 Critics of blind experiments claim that, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no experiment is truly blind,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in reference to the current reality that experimenters unblind their results
 prior to peer review and submission for publication.
 This is true, but it hides the power of the blind -- forcing complete and
 equal attention to each 
\emph on
known
\emph default
 systematic effect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PlateWash is not a blind experiment.
 It is a precursor to a blind experiment.
 More than half of the science data were taken without a blind, largely
 because we had not discovered a way to monitor the health of the experiment
 without access to data which included the central values of each measurement.
 In the latter half of science data-taking, it became clear that watching
 the errorbars on each cut was sufficient to ensure data quality.
 In this first iteration of PlateWash, our understanding of the instrument's
 metrology was in continuous refinement, which frustrated any attempt to
 inject a fake signal into the data as they were acquired.
 (Furthermore, the physical separation between pendulum and attractor DAQ
 systems would make doing so extremely difficult).

The analysis proceeded as if it were blind, to demonstrate the suitability

Assorted GNU/Unix tools

The benevolent computer engineers of yore have left us many gifts.
 This thesis relies heavily upon bash, awk, sed, grep, and many other tools
 of the standard UNIX command set.
 While these tools may appear cryptic or antiquated to a young physicist,
 they're very powerful.
 All the problems smart people had in the 1970s are the same problems smart
 people have now.
 The benefit is that the smart people in the past have left us their tools.

Bash is the scripting language for a standard UNIX shell (and the name of
 the shell itself).
 Awk is designed for handling tabular arrays of data of all kinds.

 This enables quick catching of integration bugs and allows collaborators

 Furthermore, frequent builds provide a clear picture of the deliverable

 For a blinded experiment with an automated unblinding procedure, this is
 essential.
 A primitive bug-tracking system allowed quantitative tracking of progress.

This software project has insufficient testing coverage.

 coverage is complete.
 Most sincere apologies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unit tests are used to verify that each individual function in a project
 delivers the expected output.
 If individual program units have failings, it is impossible for an assembly
 of those program units not to contain failures.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Testing is perhaps best explained by example.
 In our field, it is customary for everyone to regard the normalization
 of any FFT program as suspect until proven otherwise.
 One of the standard checks is to verify that the integrated real-space
 power and the integrated Fourier-space power are equal.
 People usually try a few inputs until they're approximately satisfied that
 the results behave as expected.
 What if that were programatic? If, before you made serious use of a library,
 you could hit 'test', and the software could run a predefined set of such
 tests.
 It is 
\emph on
much
\emph default
 easier to check whether a test is written correctly than it is to verify
 that code is correctly-written.
 Testing is a requisite part of quality software development, and data analysis
 is software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is further possible to do 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 There is very little integration test coverage in this project.
 As a partial check, many of the plots rendered throughout this thesis will
 allow the reader to verify that the analysis is approximately correct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Octave has a very handy syntax for integrating unit tests into functions.
 Before the PlateWash analysis begins, the entire set of homespun Octave
 libraries is tested.
 As the testing coverage grows, the integrity of the project will grow.

While the

 geometry affords us many luxuries of alignment, where many corrections
 to gravitational imperfections in the basic setup are second-order, it

 arbitrary mass configurations.
 Furthermore, the calculations must be sufficiently simple that they may
 be easily audited.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While it is less computationally-efficient, and can have numerical rounding
 concerns, we have chosen to simulate the Newtonian signals in PlateWash
 by breaking field and test masses into aggregations of many small point
 masses and computing the simple sums of forces and torques between them.
 Done this way, there is only the inverse square law to implement correctly.

Rotation

\begin_layout Standard
Rotation is, as always, more complicated.
 The rotation scheme used here is to define a direction in space, as viewed
 from the origin, then specify a rotation angle about that axis.
 Each sub-component point mass of a distribution is individually rotated
 through multiplication by a rotation matrix

Shapes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is convenient to define a small library of basic shapes from which larger
 objects may be created.
 In combination with translation and rotation, a few shapes can be used
 to represent almost anything.
 The simple mass-distribution representation also allows the easy construction
 of more ornate combinations.

Right Annular Prism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is convenient to develop a function for generating both round sheets
 and rings at the same time, as a round sheet is a ring with zero inner
 radius.
 This function places points on a cartesian grid, with points accepted if
 they're internal to the specified mass.
 Grid spacing along the in-plane direction and axial direction may be independen
tly selected.

Attractor

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Superposition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The planar sheets utilize a critical principle of superposition.
 In the region where the pendulum-attractor separation is comparable to
 the grid spacing, any pointwise calculation of forces and torques is almost
 guaranteed to be erroneous or require careful attention.
 This difficulty can be bypassed entirely by superposition.
 The gravitational field from a cylindrical sheet can be computed either
 directly, or by computing the force from a large annulus that represents
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

missing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 mass from an infinite sheet that the cylindrical sheet purports to represent
 and subtracting it from the known-uniform force due to an infinite sheet.
 As all pointwise separations are large in the latter case, any questions
 of grid overlap are rendered moot.

We spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to generate a satisfactory
 test of the inverse square law without a measurement of the foil position.
 We were never able to find another way.
 For experiments of this type, where the attractor is modulated toward and
 away from the an isolating foil, estimates of the sensor/foil coupling
 and the foil motion itself are essential.
 This is the first measurement of which we are aware to make a direct on-line
 measurement of the isolating foil's displacement; an important step forward.

 Careful temperature control, current control, and current selection helped,

 In fact, it is so stable against temperature drift that we have been unable

 Without it, we spent hours attempting to position the fiber for proper
 fringe contrast.
 As the fiber-foil separation is on the order of tens of microns, it is

 On one somber occasion, we punctured a foil with the fiber tip.
 The current system is simple and suffers the backlash and imprecision inherent
 in servo actuation, but it is sufficient to gain useful control over fringe
 contrast.

Early in the experiment (2007-8), we uncovered an unexpected systematic
 effect: The pendulum torque signal was periodic in the attractor stroke,
 with periodicity of 
\begin_inset Formula $25$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m.
 This matches the encoder grating spacing on the Micro-e encoder used to
 read out the attractor position.
 We had operated for several months before noticing this effect; it is quite
 natural when hunting for a signal with typical length

m to use strokes and starting positions in increments of

m.
 It was only when we tried essentially-random stroke lengths that the prominent
 effect appeared.
 Powering-off the attractor encoder eliminated the spatially-periodic torque
 signal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This effect drove us to make two major changes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pneumatic attractor position metrology: This effect made it clear that electrica
l pickup within the apparatus could become a concern.
 By moving to the precision pressure gauge as a way of ascertaining the
 attractor's position, it was possible to do a complete end-to-end test
 for any electrical pickup associated with the attractor (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Attractor-position-control"

\end_inset

).
 Once the pressure gauge was shown to be a useable encoder by intercomparison
 with the position encoder, the position encoder was turned off and disconnected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Strong emphasis on random/Monte Carlo-like attractor positioning.
 For any given lengthscale and interaction type, there is, in general, an
 optimum square-wave attractor motion to hunt for it.
 Random positioning helps to elucidate any strange systematic effects, and
 allows an unbiased search to answer the question

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What we did not do, and should have, was to hunt down the way by which the
 encoder signal coupled to the experiment.
 The encoder operates at internal lock-in frequencies from 1-25
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

MHz, with delicate grounding requirements.
 We presume that the cross-coupling was through the autocollimator; exposed
 and unshielded leads extend for several inches within the vacuum chamber
 between the autocollimator's position-sensitive photodiode outputs and
 the high-gain transimpedance preamplifiers.
 This is a major target for future upgrades of the experiment.
 It is straightforward to shorten the leads by an order of magnitude and
 implement full electrical shielding for the photodiode and preamplifiers.

\begin_layout Standard
It was decided early in the experiment (~2007-8) to ground the pendulum
 directly to the internal grounding block, giving a clear reference for
 ground.
 Furthermore, it was observed early on that the addition of 0.1-10
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

M
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 resistors to the grounding of the attractor and foil gave improved noise
 and killed off any inexplicable signals we saw.
 This was very early in our understanding of the instrument; it felt like
 fine-tuning, but as we frequently run other experiments with 10-100
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

k
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 resistors in series with the torsion fiber to protect it from electric
 transients and because the equilibration time of even a nanofarad capacitance
 across a megaohm resistor is 
\begin_inset Formula $>10^{5}$
\end_inset

 times shorter than the signal frequency, we left them in and turned to
 more-pressing concerns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Later, the sense that we had fine-tuned the apparatus and that at higher
 frequencies, the foil and attractor were effectively floating crept back
 in, and we decided that it would be better to bypass the resistors with
 large capacitors.
 We made that change and proceeded for years to refine the instrument.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 2012, the experiment was not blind, and an apparent inverse-square-law-violat
ing signal was clearly resolved.
 The signal was too large to have been an ISL violation, as prior experiments
 would have trivially resolved it, too.
 At a suggestion from Krishna Venkteswara, the wires leading to the capacitors
 were clipped (at the same time we altered the lock-in frequency and, alas,
 separately disconnected the contact-potential control system), and the
 signal vanished, dropping into the noise resolvable overnight.
 In addition, the instrumental performance improved.
 Re-introducing the capacitors restored the signal, and shorting out the
 resistor with a wire also yielded a large signal.
 With no other reason to believe that the experiment had a problem, we began
 the science run reported here shortly thereafter, with the capacitors removed.

Understanding the capacitor systematic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As hinted by Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:The-Capacitor-Systematic"

\end_inset

, our best understanding is that the movement of the attractor tunes an
 LCR resonance or resonances inside the experiment.
 The capacitance between the attractor and foil changes with attractor position,
 and the inductance of the wires connecting the elements together is sufficient
 to form an LC resonator.
 Adding sufficient series resistance to spoil the resonator 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 will squelch the effect, which we believe the resistor does.
 Bridging the resistor with a large capacitor provides an alternate path
 for high-frequency currents, restoring the resonator's 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Identifying the resonance gives us a culprit, but not a mechanism.
 Our best guess as to how a tunable resonance might influence the torque
 signal follows similar reasoning as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Encoder-narrative"

\end_inset

; while the attractor encoder is left unpowered, an encoder monitoring the
 fiber position perpendicular to the foil is left powered and operating
 in order to retain datum information.
 This encoder may be radiating RF power in the ~1-25
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

MHz realm; easily in range of the expected LC resonant frequencies.
 If the static encoder's RF signal couples to the autocollimator, and that
 signal is modulated by the presence of a new resonance in the experimental
 environment, a false apparent torque could emerge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, the presence of the foil alllows a second possible, though
 less likely, coupling mechanism.
 Any mechanical resonance or displacement that could be driven by an increased
 effective attractor-foil or pendulum-foil voltage could also appear as
 a false torque.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is certain is that clipping the capacitors out of the system substantially
 eliminates this systematic.

 The sensors are hand calibrated to match each other and the exterior sensors
 prior to day 608.
 Reliability of this calibration is low, but sufficient, as the important
 scaling quantities are the ratios of the heated temperature and gradient

 it may correspond to a temperature rise within the PlateWash enclosure.

Subtracting the foil-related torque is delicate.
 If we get the sign of the effect wrong, we double the systematic signal
 instead of subtracting it.
 For this reason, we will present our final results with the signal subtracted,
 with no subtraction, and with the signal added, so the importance of the
 effect will be apparent to the reader.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, we must address the uncertainty in the subtraction.
 To do so, when bootstrapping the model fit, with each bootstrap, we subtract
 a different one of the bootstrapped fits from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, thus the scatter in the bootstrapped fits propagates directly into the
 scatter of our model best-fits.

With these data, it is possible to place useful limits upon other inverse-square
 law modifications such as a power-law potential, Fat Gravitons, Chameleons,
 Unparticles, and more.
 For each scenario, a new approach must be taken to properly address systematic
 uncertainties.
 For this reason, this thesis limits its results to Yukawa potentials.

The PlateWash experiment began as an attempt to make a lightning strike
 into new territory.
 The design is efficient, there is no more powerful geometry for raw signal.
 The systematic uncertainties for Newtonian gravity are easy, the rest are
 hard.

The field of avalanche safety, and professional risk management more generally,
 shares its soul with experimental physics: the control of systematic uncertaint
y.
 In the case of avalanches, if you underestimate your uncertainty more than
 a few times, you die.
 If you overestimate your uncertainty, you never get to play in the mountains.
 For physicists, the situation is similar; if we report a violation of Newton's
 Inverse Square Law Of Gravitation, and it's not true, our careers are damaged,
 if not ended.
 If we cower in fear of uncertainty, we'll never learn anything new about
 Nature.
 There is real value too be had for physicists who study risk management
 [XXXMA].

\begin_layout Standard
In the modern avalanche world, communication and an understanding of human
 interactions are prized.
 The hazards present in avalanche-prone snow can be prominent or subtle;
 it is the subtle ones that kill most often.
 In most avalanche accidents, someone in the group has correctly identified
 the hazard that will eventually harm someone and is concerned about it
 prior to the accident [XXXMA].
 It is more rare for a group to get in trouble if it has discussed everyone's
 safety concerns.
 Everyone has blind spots, sometimes exacerbated by our environments.
 For us, as physicists, I believe it is the same.

Our single biggest mistake is the lack of a complete quantitative error
 budget.
 This seems like a childish oversight, but it's inherent to every modern
 short-range gravity experiment (XXXMA does Spero have one?) because it
 is extremely difficult to do.
 When we proposed the experiment, we submitted a reasonable error

While it was first imagined as a short-range equivalence principle test,
 and again as a competing design idea to the early Eot-Wash 10-hole pendulum
 design, PlateWash, as it exists now, was sold in 2006-7 as a chance to
 jump ahead of the existing technology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our action mirrored this philosophy.
 The goal was to push for the single best measurement we could get, as quickly
 as we could.
 We put off complete solutions to systematic concerns in favor of estimates
 and a promise to tie up loose ends when the measurement was complete.
 When the experiment was first assembled, our first day of data easily surpassed
 the first Eot-Wash short-range experiments; we were on our way, led by
 the huge potential of PlateWash's efficient design.
