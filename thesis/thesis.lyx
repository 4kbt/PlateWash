Introduction

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Not every thesis requires introduction.
 For reasons which will hopefully become clear, this one does.
 The experimental challenges that shaped the design, implementation, analysis,
 and results of the PlateWash experiment should be introduced even before
 we begin.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The motivation for this experiment is simple.
 Nobody knows what gravity does over distances shorter than ~100 microns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The Newtonian theory of gravity, and its refinement General Relativity,
 agree with every experimental test yet completed.
 Using these theories, we have considerable predictive power, particularly
 for orbital mechanics.
 These theories are mathematically incompatible with the 
\emph on
exceedingly
\emph default
 well-tested theory of the Standard Model.
 An important example: There is no quantum mechanics in the theory of gravity.
 New theories that attempt to resolve this tension tend to predict novel
 behavior of gravity over short distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The forces with which we are concerned are small -- ~50 fN.
 On the scale of modern gravitational experiment, however, they're somewhat
 large; our group's equivalence principle measurements measure forces on
 similar masses that are 100 times smaller.
 So, the primary task is not to prove that such an experiment is sufficiently
 sensitive, but rather to prove that we're not seeing or hiding a Standard
 Model background that mimics gravity.

Motivation and Background

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Four fundamental interactions are known.
 In historical order of characterization, they are gravity, which governs
 planetary motions; electromagnetism, which describes the interactions of
 electrically charged objects, and the weak force and strong forces, which
 govern nuclear and subnuclear dynamics.
 The electric and weak forces were unified theoretically by XXX as the electrowe
ak interaction in XXX.
 The strong force is described well by quantum chromodynamics.
 The resulting theory of the electroweak and the strong, precisely tested,
 finely tuned, and quantum in nature, is known as the Standard Model.
 Einstein's theory of gravity, general relativity, is consistent with all
 precision tests, but it contains no known links to the Standard Model.
 For interactions with sufficiently high energy density, one or both theories
 must fail, as they predict different phenomena.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Standard Model is a triumph.
 It is a complex theory, with 18 or more parameters (particle masses, coupling
 constants, and mixing parameters) which are tuned to fit observation.
 After tuning, the Model has predictive power, correctly recovering within
 experimental and theoretical error the known zoo of observed particles,
 resonances, and phenomena, with very few exceptions.
 The exceptions are, therefore, very important.
 The Standard Model has one major remaining prediction - the existence of
 the so-called Higgs boson, a lynchpin for the theory, which may have been
 discovered at the LHC in 2012

 Model are

Neutrino mass, oscillation: The Standard Model admits only massless left-handed

 Furthermore, the mass and flavor eigenstates of the neutrino are not the

\begin_layout Standard
Newton proposed the gravitational inverse square law in 16XXX in order to
 explain the motions of celestial bodies.
 He suggested that the gravitational force between two objects is always
 attractive, is proportional to the mass of each object, and inversely proportio
nal to the square of the distance between them.
 This model was remarkably good at predicting the motion of celestial orbits,
 the tides, and gave the first quantitative value for the mass of the Earth.

XXX Did Newton also compute the strength at Earth's surface? Was it empirical,

The inverse square law (ISL) for gravity has been subjected to many experimental

 The observed stability of elliptical orbits and the apparent validity of
 Kepler's laws gave immediate support to the theory at solar system scales.

String Theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
String theory provided the catalyst for a resurgence of interest in the
 inverse square law at sub-millimeter scales in the late 1990s.
 At the cost of as many as seven extra dimensions, the theory offers a the
 promise of unifying gravity with the other forces.
 The extra dimensions are hidden away from normal observation with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compactification
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; the introduction of a scale shorter than which extra dimensions are relevant
 to particle interactions and longer than which any effects of extra dimensions
 are suppressed.
 Critically, the effects of gravity would be sensitive to the change in
 dimensionality by obeying Gauss' Law at all scales - diluting gravity into
 the many extra dimensions at short distances, while diluting into only
 three spatial dimensions at longer scales.
 String theories predict that gravity will get significantly more attractive
 at scales shorter than the compactification scale.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If parametrized as a particle-exchange theory, string theory predicts two
 new types of exchange particles, known as the dilaton and the radion.
 Both would appear gravitationally as Yukawa violations of the inverse square
 law at scales comparable to the compactification length.
 The dilaton is responsible for the familiar Gauss' law increase in strength
 of gravity, while the radion is associated with excitations of the periodic
 spacetime normally accorded to the compactified dimensions.

 Self interactions act to

 the effect of any new interaction.
 As self-interaction is a general property of fields, the notion is quite
 reasonable.
 In its simplest form as a scalar field, XXX (Lagrangian), a chameleon interacti
on must be constrained by limiting not only the exchange particle's mass
 
\begin_inset Formula $m$

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to their physical motiviation, chameleon interactions are ready-made
 to evade traditional inverse square law tests.
 All precision tests of short-range gravity at gravitational strength to

 Because of XXX, the isolating foil significantly enhances the effective
 self-screening of the chameleon interaction.
 When searching for this class of interactions, the isolating material must

Precision measurements of the distance dependence of gravity may have begun

 Kepler's Laws [XXX] are now taught to students as necessary corrolaries

 Astronomical tests of gravity remain the most precise, providing direct

 In order of decreasing range and increasing precision, the currently leading
 solar system tests of gravity are the Pioneer spacecraft [XXX], the Cassini
 mission to Saturn [XXX], radar ranging to Mars [XXX], and the very precise
 lunar laser ranging [XXX].
 The lunar results are, up to any theoretical uncertainties in the complicated

 Any disagreement between observations of the Casimir force and the Casimir
 theory could possibly be due to new physics.

Principle - Gauss' Law Test
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For Coulomb potentials, the field of an infinite sheet of charge is uniform.
 Its strength does not vary with distance from the sheet, nor does its direction.
 This is normally derived by making use of Gauss' law.
 Indeed, it may be shown that, in three dimensions, any force that obeys
 a 
\begin_inset Formula $1/r$
\end_inset

 potential satisfies Gauss' law XXX and vice versa XXX.
 Our experiment is a test of the uniformity of the gravitational field of
 an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

infinite
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sheet of mass.
 It is in this sense that our experiment is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Gauss' law test of gravity.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In its idealized form, our experiment compares the gravitational field strength
 at two distances from an infinite sheet of mass.
 Finite sheet masses are suspended on opposite sides of a torsion pendulum
 aligned parallel to their moment arms, but displaced in opposite directions
 perpendicular to the arms.
 If there is an inverse square law violating force between the sheets on
 the pendulum and an infinite sheet of matter, the pendulum will feel a
 torque.
 If the distance between the pendulum and the sheet is modulated, the torque
 will vary in sync with the modulation.
 If there are no inverse square law violating interactions between the pendulum
 and sheet, the pendulum will experience 
\emph on
no torque
\emph default
.
 The difficulties in the measurement primarily involve ensuring that the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

infinite sheet
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 approximation is valid and that gravity is the only messenger between the
 infinite sheet and the pendulum.

 Neglecting edge effects, if one plate is infinite in spatial extent, the

 It is a physical and electrical barrier between pendulum and attractor.
 If it moves in an attractor-correlated way, the pendulum's electrostatic
 environment will change.
 In order to assess the foil's motion, we built an interferometric optical
 sensor system.

, the device interferes light from a reference surface and a reflecting
 target surface.
 In this case, the reference surface is the end of an optical fiber, and
 the reflecting target surface is the PlateWash isolating foil.
 As shown in Fig XXX, light from a fiber-coupled laser (Q-Photonics QDFBLD-1300-
10) is directed through a 90/10 fiber coupler (ThorLabs FC1310-70-10-APC).
 The light that travels down the 90% branch is absorbed by an intensity
 monitor photodiode.
 The remaining 10% is coupled into a fiber that goes to the apparatus.
 The end of the fiber is carefully directed and positioned next to the isolating
 foil.
 Approximately 4% of the light leaving the fiber is reflected from the glass/vac
uum interface.
 Due to the divergence of the beam (NA 0.14, mode field diameter 9.2

\begin_inset Formula $\mu$

m), less light re-enters the fiber core after reflecting from the foil.
 By adjusting the fiber-foil distance, it is possible to tune the internally
 and externally-reflected light to have comparable intensity, maximizing
 the interference contrast.
 In PlateWash, the operating point is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim XXX\pm XXX$

The reflected light returns down the fiber to the 90/10 splitter.
 90% of the light goes into an InGaAs high-sensitivity photodiode (ThorLabs

 The remaining 10% proceeds back to the laser, where it is blocked by a
 Faraday isolator.

Calibration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order for the intensity values measured at the photodiode to be meaningful,
 we must develop an intensity-change to displacement conversion.
 As the intensity at the output port varies sinusoidally with foil position,
 the sensitivity of the instrument is spatially-varying.
 With the initial visible-light laser, we attempted to lock the fringe phase
 into the location of maximum sensitivity by varying the laser temperature
 temperature, and hence frequency.
 With the infrared distributed-feedback laser, the temperature coefficient
 is so small that such an approach cannot work.
 Future versions of the experiment may include positioning feedback for
 the fiber mount in order to maximize sensitivity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Determining fringe contrast can be done by displacing the foil.
 The attractor can be pressed into the foil by lightly over-driving the
 translation stage.
 If valves are manipulated to permit a slow retreat of the attractor (or
 using the very slow leak of the isolation valve), a fringe pattern may
 be obtained.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it is challenging to infer anything about foil motion near a fringe turning

 We only consider times when the interferometer was in the middle 71% (
\begin_inset Formula $\sin(\pi/4)=\sqrt{2}/2=0.707$

) of the range of fringe contrast.
 Over the same range, the slope of the fringe-to-displacement sinusoid varies
 by at most 21% away from the mean (average slope 
\begin_inset Formula $2\sqrt{2}/\pi$
\end_inset

, maximum 1, minimum 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}/2$
\end_inset

 ).
 As we are only interested in an estimate (and hopefully an upper bound)
 on the foil's contribution to pendulum torque, this will be sufficient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

, torsion balances in imperfect vacuum are damped by the residual atmosphere.
 Microscopically, there is only one form of gas damping - collisions between
 gas particles and an oscillator allow momentum and energy exchange.
 Experimentally, when the particle mean free path is larger than the dimensions
 of the chamber, gas damping appears in two forms: 'free' damping and 'proximity
-enhanced' damping.
 Free gas damping is independent of an oscillator's location in a vacuum
 chamber, and depends only upon properties of the gas:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Proximity-enhanced gas damping is geometry dependent.
 It arises in regions of constrained gas flow.
 Restricted volumes of gas that are compressed/rarified by oscillator motion
 have slight over/under-pressure that opposes the oscillator's motion.
 If the restricted volume's equilibration time

\begin_layout Standard
The gold-coated surfaces of our pendulum and foil are some mixture of amorphous
 and polycrystalline materials.
 According to XXX (who?!?!?) the surface environment evolves over time,
 as crystals slowly change.
 This gives rise to a changing electrostatic environment at each surface.
 Our pendulum and foil are gold coated in order to minimise this effect
 - gold's work function is only weakly-dependent on crystal orientation
 XXX.
 Once the pendulum-foil separation is small compared to the characteristic
 size of any metallic patches, we expect this effect to be important.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Estimating or measuring the size of this effect is a challenge.
 Our pendulums may be more sensitive to this effect than available Kelvin
 probes, it's difficult to compare with surface-physics experiments due
 to differing surface preparation and vacuum properties, etc.

\begin_layout Standard
Experimentally, all of our group's short-range experiments have seen increased

 The PlateWash autocollimator's noise floor is approximately XXX, as seen

 Because of the pendulum's

 response function at high frequency, angle readout noise is the primary
 limit on the instruments' torque sensitivity at high frequency.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Environment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A number of environmental factors can give rise to extra noise in the balance.
 Careful design and construction helps to limit these effects.

 acquisition into quite parts of the day, week, and year.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Ground motion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several ways in which ground motion can cause an apparent pendulum
 torque:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Rotation of the ground: This rotates the instrument relative to the pendulum
 and appears as a spurious torque.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
'Tilt feedthrough': Asymmetry in the fiber cross-section converts the tilt
 of the fiber support into a pendulum twist.
 This is suppressed, but not eliminated, by the fiber 'prehanger'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Magnetic damper asymmetry: If the field of the swing damper is inhomogeneous,
 and the prehanger mass has a magnetic moment, damper swing will be converted
 to a torque.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Vertical bouncing: up-down motion of the pendulum changes the tensile stress
 in the fiber.
 There is a connection between fiber stress and equilibrium position, so
 vertical shaking may give rise to apparent torques.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Electrostatic interaction with nearby surfaces: For PlateWash, and most
 short-range experiments, this is the dominant effect.
 Asymmetric position-dependent pendulum interactions with the foil, control
 electrodes, and nearby grounded surfaces easily create powerful torques
 on the pendulum.
 Careful minimization of contact potentials is essential to reduce tilt/swing
 couplings.
 XXX elaborate.
 With simple modification and bias voltages, the PlateWash balance can become
 a powerful tilt sensor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Seismic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Earthquakes worldwide can affect the balance.
 Quakes of magnitude 3+ in the immediate region (Northern California to

 Large quakes, such as the recent Chilean and Japanese quakes, disturb Earth
 so violently that it can take a day or more before aftershocks and low-frequenc
y modes of terrestrial vibration have damped.

 Recent estimates by Krishna Venkateswara and Todd Wagner put the ambient

While the coupling mechanism to wind is presumably seismic, tilt, gravitational

 The largest and closest surface to the pendulum is the foil.
 Minimizing the pendulum-foil contact potential,

, can have considerable impact on pendulum noise.
 Because of a non-constant contact potential as a function of pendulum angle,
 we were unable to trim

 as well as should be possible in principle.
 Furthermore, as seen in section XXX, we chose to give up control of

 Direct grounding of the foil is no longer required.

 The room temperature varies by less than XXX through the year and XXX every

As passive isolation, the vacuum system is an excellent insulator, with

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Instrumental noise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many electronic effects can create excess noise.
 Most pick-up effects are indistinguishable from autocollimator noise.
 Because PlateWash normally operates in electrostatic feedback, there is
 a second channel through which EMF pickup, ground loops, and finite digital-to-
analog conversion noise can couple to the pendulum.
 These effects may be assessed by comparing the pendulum noise with and
 without the feedback electrodes grounded.

 The valve is positioned downstream of the electronic pressure gauge.
 The valve may be closed, and

electrical signal associated with the operation of the experiment is unchanged.
 The data analysis system is also unchanged, making it possible to test

 To estimate the size of this effect, two independent quadrature programs
 were written.
 When completed, it was discovered that one trivial bug separated the two
 codes from nearly exact agreement.
 See XXX for a description of both methods.
 As expected from flat surfaces in the near field, the torque vs.
 distance curves are predominantly linear.
 For a properly centered pendulum, the expected torque is XXX N-m/m.
 The quadratic term is XXX N-m/m^2.
 There is a left-right asymmetry of the curve due to the asymmetry of the

Voids/defects in materials
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Small non-uniformities in density of the attractor or pendulum materials
 can mimic or mask a signal.
 The flat plate geometry of the experiment renders this effect largely second
 order.
 In the absence of an attractor non-uniformity, a pendulum void should be
 expected to have no effect at all.
 In the absence of a pendulum non-uniformity, an attractor void will cause
 a lateral position-dependent torque.
 If the attractor void were to occur near the outer corner of the pendulum
 (worst case), the torque would be XXX N-m/ (cubic micron of attractor).
 In the event that two voids are laterally coincident, the maximum torque
 difference would be XXX N-m/(cubic micron of void).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Horizontal displacement of the pendulum is an excellent test for the local
 effects.
 The largest voids observed in the surfaces under a microscope are about
 XXX in size.
 Note that a distribution of voids across the surface can, with sufficiently
 many voids, be viewed as a reduction in the density of the material.
 This is especially true if the voids are smaller than a characteristic
 length-scale of interest.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Attractor mount/flexure/bellows gravity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The motion of the attractor mount, spindles, flexure, and bellows introduces
 a small, largely linear, torque background.
 The linear background is expected to be XXX Nm/m.
 The spindles contribute the dominant nonlinear term, which is expected
 to be < XXX N-m/m^2 (or N-m/m^3).

\begin_layout Standard
The dense inlays of the attractor and the dense material of the attractor

 It is possible that an air bubble may have become laterally very large
 when the glue layer was pressed.
 Assuming a 1 cm diameter by 1 micron thick glue bubble in both the pendulum

Spindle screw voids
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The attractor's aluminum body is attached to aluminum spindles using aluminum
 set screws.
 The screws are matched in length and mass to better than XXX um and XXX
 g.
 The screws and spindles are installed such that the mass distribution is
 most mirror-symmetric about the vertical plane perpendicular to the attractor
 face and coincident with the torsion fiber.
 The set screws were screwed all the way into the attractor, then the spindles
 were screwed onto the screws.
 The remaining voids in the attractor and spindle housings are expected
 to give rise to torques of XXX N-m/m and nonlinearities of XXX N-m/m^2.

 by the lapping process, which dominates the rms flatness.
 After a spatial lowpass at XXX scale, the rms roughness of the surfaces
 was XXX um (attractor) and XXX um (pendulum).
 In addition, the pendulum materials' differing hardnesses led to a step
 at the dense/light interface of XXX um.
 A plot of all the surfaces is shown in Fig XXX.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Tilt/apparatus deformation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tilt sensitivity is a general affliction of torsion balances.
 Perhaps because of eccentricity of fine torsion fibers, all balances exhibit
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tilt feedthrough
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In short range interaction experiments, the tilt feedthrough is exacerbated
 by the importance of spatially varying electrostatic potentials.
 The apparatus has a two-axis tilt sensor, but it was intentionally turned
 off during data taking to minimize any electromagnetic interference.
 The pendulum autocollimator is sensitive along both vertical and horizontal
 axes, and provides a continuous measurement of pendulum tilt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Nonlinear tilt feedthrough
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The apparatus may have attractor-related tilt for a number of reasons, including
 the displacement of the center of mass of the attractor assembly, deformations
 of the attractor mount, and changing geometry of the attractor air line.
 The flexure was mounted from its center in order to minimize any deformation
 of the apparatus as a whole.
 The deflection is expected to be both small and primarily linear, limiting
 the impact on the measurement.
 We initially estimated the effect of tilt by considering only center of
 mass motion, finding ~XXX N-m
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Flexure non-linearity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One interesting systematic effect that can exhibit considerable nonlinearity
 is the nonlinearity of the flexure itself.
 Most tilt-related effects are essentially blind to the attractor-foil distance.
 In order to maximise our use of the flexure's limited (<2mm) travel, the
 flexure's internal travel limit was located not far from the point at which
 the attractor pressed hard into the foil.
 If the double-compensating mechanism of the flexure experiences nonlinear
 stress near the (artificially-placed with mechanical stops) end of its
 travel, nonlinear stresses might be communicated to the baseplate.
 XXX not sure how to estimate this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Magnetism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Magnetic systematics are among the most difficult to assess in these experiments.
 The foil provides limited, if any, shielding against low frequency magnetic
 fields.
 Because of the considerable strength of the magnetic interaction, great
 care must be taken to ensure that magnetic effects do not mimic or mask
 a gravitational signal.
 For the shortest-range effects, the torsion balance may be the most sensitive
 probe for their existence, complicating things considerably.
 Short range gravity research is becoming increasingly sophisticated in
 this realm; previous tests have only considered some of these effects.

Diffuse contamination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If impurities are sufficiently numerous, then their presence will only appear
 in the force/torque once the pendulum/attractor separation is smaller than
 the characteristic separation of the impurities.
 Only one surface must be contaminated for this effect to appear, as all
 materials in the problem have magnetic permeability different from vacuum.

 attractor position,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Modulation of background magnetic fields
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The magnetic permeability of the attractor and pendulum materials will affect
 any background magnetic fields.
 In addition to Earth's field, the largely non-magnetic apparatus will still
 have a residual field.
 The magnetic damper is quite close to the pendulum, and is only partially
 shielded.

Foil-Attractor temperature difference

\begin_layout Standard
If there is a temperature gradient between the foil and the attractor, attractor

 rise to a false signal.
 Heaters and thermistors were installed on board the attractor spindles
 to magnify and study this effect.
 Studies by XXX show that heat transfer is enhanced over very short distances

Initial Alignment

\begin_layout Standard
XXX! The experiment was initially aligned using the autocollimator.
 The attractor was fixed in place against two registry blocks and firmly
 clamped.
 The autocollimator was then centered on the attractor and aligned such
 that the light returned to near the center of the sensor.
 The up-down and left-right angles were recorded.
 The attractor was then translated through its full range of motion, and
 the position on the autocollimator recorded.
 The attractor was adjusted to a point ~20
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m from the desired working position.
 The foil and attractor were cleaned with dry nitrogen and with clean room
 wipes/isopropanol.
 The foil was then placed in front of the attractor and iteratively aligned
 to the attractor using a combination of the autocollimator readout and
 a measurement of the attractor-foil capacitance.
 Gross alignment was done by hand.
 Fine adjustment was done using the Belleville washers on the foil mount.
 When optical alignment reached XXX 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

rad, a capacitance of ~3-400 pF was achieved, and the capacitance seemed
 to be at a minimum as a function of attractor-foil angle, the system was
 declared to be aligned.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Cleaning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the attractor and foil were aligned, it was essential to remove any
 debris/dust in the gap between them.
 To characterize the amount of dust in the gap, and to verify alignment,
 the attractor-foil capacitance was measured as a function of attractor
 position, including positions where the attractor touched the foil.
 Touching was, at this step, determined by noting the position where the
 capacitance reading became unreliable.
 The maximum capacitance recorded without signs of touching gave a proxy
 for the minimum attractor-foil separation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The attractor assembly was removed and the attractor face cleaned with isopropan
ol, clean room wipes, and dry nitrogen.
 The same was done with the attractor side of the foil.
 Both attractor and foil were visually inspected for dust.
 The attractor assembly was replaced against the registry blocks and re-clamped.
 The attractor-foil capacitance was measured as a function of attractor
 position.
 The cleaning procedure was repeated until no gains in capacitance were
 observed with subsequent cleanings.
 Typical maximum capacitances were ~2

Online Alignment

\begin_layout Standard
The critical distances between and relative orientations of the pendulum,
 foil, and attractor were determined with the bell jar closed, under vacuum,
 and after bake-out.
 A number of methods were explored, but the method of choice was as follows:
 The freely twisting pendulum was allowed to tap the foil as the attractor
 was pressed into the foil by the flexure stage.
 As the attractor displaced the foil, the angular amplitude of the tapping
 signal necessarily decreased to zero.
 The point where this occurred was used as a reference to determine the
 absolute distance between the pendulum and the attractor (XXX we should
 repeat at another phitop position?).
 The pendulum twist at this point was taken to be the angle at which the
 pendulum was parallel to the attractor (XXX what about 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

Choosing a frequency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the first harmonic is the only signal of importance (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "sub:Harmonics"

\end_inset

), we should place the first harmonic at the location of lowest noise (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Experimentally-determined-noise"

\end_inset

).
 Furthermore, we are driven by statistics (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Statistics"

\end_inset

) to operate at the highest practical frequency.
 The required use of lags to eliminate systematic uncertainties places a
 soft upper bound on usable frequencies (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Lags"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The operating frequency was chosen well in advance of the science run reported
 here, before the instrument was fully understood.
 We selected a frequency that we expected would give low noise and was sufficien
tly slow to allow transients associated with attractor motion to damp.

 This choice improves the performance of discrete Fourier analysis and minimizes
 beating between signal and sample frequencies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Choosing a science signal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the pendulum is locked in feedback, there are multiple data channels
 that may be used to extract a science measurement.
 The pendulum twist angle, the feedback signal itself, and the P, I, and
 D terms of the feedback loop are written to disk.
 The pendulum twist angle and the P (proportional) term of the loop are
 necessarily equivalent.
 In practice, the twist signal and P term were anti-aliased differently.
 The P term had an (XXX 3, just recheck) s filter applied, making it the
 signal of choice for a twist measurement.
 The loop was operated with zero I-term, so the I channel contains no signal.
 The D (derivative) term responds like 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

, making it unsuited to low frequency signal extraction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, there are two reasonable science channels: the feedback signal applied
 to the pendulum, and the P term.
 The feedback signal has units of torque, the P term has units of angle.
 Even though the pendulum is held fixed, the torque-angle transfer function
 remains important.
 At frequencies below the resonance of the pendulum, the two channels are
 directly proportional.
 At frequencies above resonance, the frequency-independent angle noise of
 the autocollimator appears, in the feedback signal, as torque noise that
 rises like frequency squared.
 As shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Fourier Harmonics"

\end_inset

, the higher harmonics of the attractor motion contain no interesting signal,
 so it is in our interest to low-pass them away.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By choosing the angle signal instead of the feedback signal as the science
 signal, we use the inertia of the pendulum as an analog low-pass filter.
 While, in principle, both signals contain the science, the science signal
 is more-easily extracted from the angle signal.
 Furthermore, as the feedback signal is the sum of the P and the derived
 D terms, there's less opportunity for an error to enter into the science
 signal if the measured angle is used alone.

 the effects of spikes/kicks (earthquakes and attractor-foil contact).

Serendipity provides a solution to the problem.
 The pendulum has a magnetic moment (see XXX).
 Using a coil placed around the apparatus for systematic tests, it is possible
 to produce arbitrary torques on the pendulum.
 The attractor position is measured using an analog electronic pressure
 gauge (see XXX).
 By combining the gauge with the coil and an amplifier, it is possible to
 make an exact and magnified simulation of a gravitational signal that is
 linear in attractor position.

\begin_layout Standard
Windowing is familiar to many as a method for reducing the magnitude of
 spectral leakage in Fourier transforms.
 It is also of use, as a low-pass filter, in reducing the sensitivity of
 an averaged value to high frequency fluctuations at a modest expense in
 statistical resolving power.
 In this analysis, a Hann window is used
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Just as in periodogram estimation, the choice 
\bar under
to
\bar default
 use a window is much more important than the choice 
\bar under
of
\bar default
 a particular window.
 Several windowing schemes were explored, without significant improvement.

Lock-in
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the lags are chosen, a window selected, and a leading edge found, locking
 in is straightforward.
 Beginning at a time prescribed by a leading edge, the analysis program
 walks through each data stream, multiplies the data found in each 'step
 period' (1/2 the attractor motion period) by the properly-lagged window
 function, and computes the weighted average.
 The resulting average forms a single measurement.

The first measurement, and every other subsequent measurement, is regarded
 as an 'A' measurement.
 The second measurement, and every other subsequent measurement (the complement
 of the As), is regarded as a 'B' measurement.
 Because the pneumatic drive takes about one attractor period to come into
 equilibrium (if coming from a different A/B position pair in the previous
 cut), the first A and B measurements are dropped from quantitative analysis.

 The torsion balance feedback signal is sent through a filter whose parameters

While the torque scale is ultimately hardcoded with the value set in

 The analysis routine is designed to fit and subtract both the 1-
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 and 2-
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 signals from the attractor.
 The fitting algorithm implements a binary search in frequency for the maximum
 fit amplitude present in the data.
 At present, there is no cycle-mark on the calibration attractor, so no
 attempt is made to match the phase of the fit with an external phase reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To remove transients before fitting, torque data are passed through a 'spikeRemo
ver', applied to the data's time derivative.
 As the calibration signal is continuous, transient signals are interpreted
 as spurious.
 Any 100 s region of data centered on a suspected spike is excised completely.
 Spike detection uses a an aggressive version of Chauvenet's criterion XXX
 (ref).
 XXX (Peirce's criteron may actually be better for this?) The implementation
 loops 20 iterations of the spike removing code to ensure that spikes of
 multiple scales (or spikes sufficiently numerous to pull the initial standard

Preventing the aliasing of high frequency noise into low frequency measurements
 is of particular importance to the PlateWash measurement.
 As the torsion balance operates in feedback, autocollimator noise, (white
 in angle), rises like 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{2}$
\end_inset

 in torque.
 As an simple anti-aliasing measure, the data within each accepted bin are
 multiplied by a parabolic (Welch) window function before averaging.
 To preserve normalization, the weights are independently accumulated, and
 the ratio of accumulated weighted data to accumulated weight is the reported
 average for each bin.

\begin_layout Standard
A clear method of visualization is important to understanding the output
 of any experiment.
 For PlateWash, the natural plot is three-dimensional.
 The experiment measures the difference in pendulum torque between two different
 attractor positions.
 So, if we plot 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau(\mbox{start},\mbox{end})$
\end_inset

, we can plot every measurement in the experiment in a single plot, as in
 Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "TriangleScatterPlot"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three dimensional plots are difficult to read, three dimensional plots with
 errorbars are worse.
 Furthermore, the scatter in a plot like Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "TriangleScatterPlot"

\end_inset

 is dominated by the noisiest points.
 As shown in XXX (plot of noise vs.
 time), the noise in PlateWash varies by orders of magnitude with environmental
 conditions; we're interested mostly in the points with least scatter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to present the result in a meaningful and two-dimensional way,
 the 'triangle plot' was developed.
 In order to improve the statistics by a factor of two, we make the assumption
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau(a,b)=\Delta\tau(b,a)$
\end_inset

, and fold the points over the 
\begin_inset Formula $a=b$
\end_inset

 axis.
 In order to plot points with uncertainties, measurements are plotted as
 circles in the 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b$
\end_inset

 plane.
 The magnitude of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

 is represented by the radius of the circle.
 To provide an errorbar, the region from 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau+\sigma_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau-\sigma_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 is plotted in grey.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau-\sigma_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $|\Delta\tau+\sigma_{\tau}|$
\end_inset

 are greater than zero (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 a point is off-zero with 1-
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 significance), the remainder of the circle is filled in with color.
 To represent the sign of the datapoint, yellow is negative, and blue is
 positive XXX (check sign).
 Any force of nature should satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau(a,a)=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 Any conservative force should be associative: 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau(a,c)=\Delta\tau(a,b)+\Delta\tau(b,c)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This method has limitations.
 Large signals, or large uncertainties produce large circles, which can
 hide smaller, more significant, points.
 For sparsely sampled data, however, it can be very helpful.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Bootstrap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis presented here makes extensive use of a statistical method
 called 'the bootstrap' or 'bootstrapping'.
 Its primary merit in this context is that it allows straightforward and
 reasonably robust estimation of confidence intervals.
 Its support rests upon the premise that the best estimator for the distribution
 from which a data set is drawn is the data set itself.
 The idea is to 'resample' the data to create synthetic data sets which
 may be passed through any analysis routine developed for the original data
 set.
 With repetition, this process generates distributions of important output
 quantities (best-fit points in 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha-\lambda$
\end_inset

 space, for example) without recourse to complex error estimation/propagation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resampling scheme used in this analysis was to replace a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $1/e$
\end_inset

 of the data points in a data set with others randomly selected from the
 initial data set.
 There is a related class of methods called 'the jackknife' that generate
 statistics by considering complete sets of subsets of data.

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to extracting model parameters from the data, we can reconstruct
 the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(d)$
\end_inset

, the pendulum torque as a function of attractor/pendulum separation.
 The entire data set consists of differential measurements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(d)$
\end_inset

, where the attractor measures a 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau=\tau(d_{1})-\tau(d_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 Recovering 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(d)$
\end_inset

 is then similar to recovering a function using knowledge of its derivative.
 Just as in indefinite integration, there is a

The method used to recover 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(d)$

 is simple -- attempt to find a best-fit function which minimizes the difference
 between the measured torques 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau_{meas}$
\end_inset

 and those computed using the fitting function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau_{fit}$
\end_inset

 To provide confidence intervals on the fit parameters, we bootstrap the
 measured data many times; the distribution of the extracted fit parameters
 provides the necessary foundation.

Blindness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most accurate experiments are free of bias.
 It is possible to perform an unbiased experiment without a blind, but it
 is difficult to guarantee that all pre-concieved notions of experimental
 results and implications are suppressed.
 Critics of blind experiments claim that, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no experiment is truly blind,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in reference to the current reality that experimenters unblind their results
 prior to peer review and submission for publication.
 This is true, but it hides the power of the blind -- forcing complete and
 equal attention to each 
\emph on
known
\emph default
 systematic effect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PlateWash is not a blind experiment.
 It is a precursor to a blind experiment.
 More than half of the science data were taken without a blind, largely
 because we had not discovered a way to monitor the health of the experiment
 without access to data which included the central values of each measurement.
 In the latter half of science data-taking, it became clear that watching
 the errorbars on each cut XXX(terminology?) was sufficient to ensure data
 quality.
 In this first iteration of PlateWash, our understanding of the instrument's
 metrology was in continuous refinement, which frustrated any attempt to
 inject a fake signal into the data as they were acquired.
 (Furthermore, the physical separation between pendulum and attractor DAQ
 systems would make doing so extremely difficult).
\end_layout

The analysis proceeded as if it were blind, to demonstrate the suitability
 of the analysis toolchain for a future blind analysis.
