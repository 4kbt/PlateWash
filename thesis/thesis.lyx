\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Four fundamental interactions are known.
 In historical order of characterization, they are gravity, which governs
 planetary motions; electromagnetism, which describes the interactions of
 electrically charged objects, and the weak force and strong forces, which
 govern nuclear and subnuclear dynamics.
 The electric and weak forces were unified theoretically by Glashow, Salam,
 and Weinberg as the electroweak interaction in 1967
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "GSWNobelPrize"

\end_inset

.
 The strong force is described well by quantum chromodynamics.
 The resulting theory of the electroweak and the strong, precisely tested,
 finely tuned, and quantum in nature, is known as the Standard Model.
 Einstein's theory of gravity, general relativity, is consistent with all
 precision tests, but it contains no known links to the Standard Model.
 For interactions with sufficiently high energy density, one or both theories
 must fail, as they predict different phenomena.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Standard Model is a triumph.
 It is a complex theory, with 18 or more parameters (particle masses, coupling
 constants, and mixing parameters) which are tuned to fit observation.
 After tuning, the Model has predictive power, correctly recovering within
 experimental and theoretical error the known zoo of observed particles,
 resonances, and phenomena, with very few exceptions.
 The exceptions are, therefore, very important.
 The Standard Model has one major remaining prediction - the existence of
 the so-called Higgs boson, a lynchpin for the theory, which may have been
 discovered at the LHC in 2012 .

Newton proposed the gravitational inverse square law in 1687 in order to
 explain the motions of celestial bodies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 He suggested that the gravitational force between two objects is always
 attractive, is proportional to the mass of each object, and inversely proportio
nal to the square of the distance between them.
 This model was remarkably good at predicting the motion of celestial orbits,
 the tides, and gave the first quantitative estimate for the mass of the
 Earth.

The inverse square law (ISL) for gravity has been subjected to many experimental

 The observed stability of elliptical orbits and the apparent validity of
 Kepler's laws gave immediate support to the theory at solar system scales.

String Theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
String theory provided the catalyst for a resurgence of interest in the
 inverse square law at sub-millimeter scales in the late 1990s.
 At the cost of as many as seven extra dimensions, the theory offers a the
 promise of unifying gravity with the other forces.
 The extra dimensions are hidden away from normal observation with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compactification
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; the introduction of a scale shorter than which extra dimensions are relevant
 to particle interactions and longer than which any effects of extra dimensions
 are suppressed.
 Critically, the effects of gravity would be sensitive to the change in
 dimensionality by obeying Gauss' Law at all scales - diluting gravity into
 the many extra dimensions at short distances, while diluting into only
 three spatial dimensions at longer scales.
 String theories predict that gravity will get significantly more attractive
 at scales shorter than the compactification scale.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If parametrized as a particle-exchange theory, string theory predicts two
 new types of exchange particles, known as the dilaton and the radion.
 Both would appear gravitationally as Yukawa violations of the inverse square
 law at scales comparable to the compactification length.
 The dilaton is responsible for the familiar Gauss' law increase in strength
 of gravity, while the radion is associated with excitations of the periodic
 spacetime normally accorded to the compactified dimensions.

In addition to their physical motiviation, chameleon interactions are ready-made
 to evade traditional inverse square law tests.
 All precision tests of short-range gravity at gravitational strength to
 date, including our experiment, place an isolating metal foil between the
 source and detector masses.
 Because of the self-screening within materials the isolating foil significantly
 diminishes the apparent strength of the observable interaction.
 When searching for chameleons, isolating shields must be made as thin and
 of as low a density as possible, or dispensed with entirely.

 Experimental designs become more and more carefully crafted to suppress

 If no caliper is handy, pluck a hair from your head.
 We know almost nothing about gravity on that scale.
 For every other known interaction of nature, our understanding reaches
 far below the diameter of a proton.
 That's more than 10,000,000,000 times smaller.
 At scales of a micron, gravity could be repulsive and

Principle - Gauss' Law Test
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is easily shown that, in three dimensions, any force that obeys a 
\begin_inset Formula $1/r$
\end_inset

 potential satisfies Gauss' law 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-Gm\oiint_{S}\frac{\vec{r}}{|r|^{3}}\cdot d\hat{r}=-4\pi Gm.
\]

\end_inset

 The converse is true, too: If a force law satisfies Gauss' Law, then the
 field flux through a sphere centered on a point charge must be constant
 for all sphere radii.
 As the surface area of the sphere is proportional to the square of its
 radius, then the field strength must fall as 
\begin_inset Formula $1/r^{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our experiment is a test of the uniformity of the gravitational field of
 an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

infinite
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sheet of mass.
 It is in this sense that our experiment is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Gauss' law test of gravity.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 For any force, the field from an infinite two-dimensional sheet of charge
 must, by symmetry, be perpendicular to the plane of the sheet.
 Furthermore, if the interaction obeys Gauss' law, the flux of field remains
 constant with increasing distance from the sheet..
 Therefore, the strength of the interaction cannot vary with distance.
 This fact immediately suggests a simple test for whether an interaction
 follows Gauss' Law: Measure the force acting upon a test charge at two
 different distances from a sheet of charge.
 If the two measured forces are inconsistent, then the interaction does
 not obey Gauss' Law.
 Such an experiment is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

null-test
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for any deviation from an inverse square law.
 Colloquially, it might be referred to as an

\begin_layout Standard
In idealized form, our experiment compares the gravitational field strength
 at two distances from an infinite sheet of mass.
 Finite sheet masses are suspended on opposite sides of a torsion pendulum
 aligned parallel to their moment arms, but displaced in opposite directions
 perpendicular to the arms (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Simple Parallel plate cartoon"

\end_inset

).
 If there is an inverse-square-law violating force between the sheets on
 the pendulum and an infinite sheet of matter, the pendulum will feel a
 torque.
 If the distance between the pendulum and the sheet is modulated, the torque
 will vary in sync with the modulation.
 If there are no inverse-square law-violating interactions between the pendulum
 and sheet, the pendulum will experience 
\emph on
no torque
\emph default
.
 The difficulties in the measurement primarily involve ensuring that the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 approximation is valid and that gravity is the only messenger between the
 sheet and the pendulum.

The motion control system has one non-standard property for a precision
 translation stage: it is pneumatically actuated.
 In aggregate, getting this system to work well required many months of
 effort.
 It was worth every day.
 A pneumatic actuation system is, by definition, not electrical.
 While the attractor flexure system was designed to accommodate standard
 micrometer actuators, if needed, the actuator is a phosphor-bronze bellows.
 The bellows is fed by a thin copper tube connected to a pressure-regulation
 positioned outside the vacuum chamber.
 When the system is taking science data, the position encoder for the flexure
 is a precision absolute pressure gauge outside the apparatus.
 The advantage to this arrangement is apparent when considering systematic
 uncertainties; by closing a valve between the apparatus and the pressure
 regulation/measurement system, it is possible to control for

 As described above, the

 enables complete isolation of the attractor from the outside world and
 all measuring instruments.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the equivalent of a lock on a pair of calipers; whatever air is present
 in the bellows when the valve is closed is trapped there, and the pressure/posi
tion is still measured continuously by the gauge.
 If there are no leaks and the absolute temperature (K) does not change,
 then the attractor can be held fixed in any position.
 As an additional capability, it will be seen that it can be useful for
 foil-interferometer calibration to have a controlled and very slow leak
 in the attractor drive system; the manual valves make this possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The gas-handling system was originally designed without the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

locking valve
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, but it became critical to our success.
 We had intended to operate with the pulse-width modulation valve operating
 in continuous PID feedback to pressure or position sensors, this would
 have enabled fast position changes and excellent control over the attractor's
 position.
 Alas, the the pulse-width modulation was still measurable and unacceptably
 large at the attractor -- attractor motion in measurement phases opens
 whole classes of systematic effects we do not wish to consider.
 The modulator could not be switched at higher frequencies, and any further
 passive low-pass filters would compromise the speed of our attractor motion.
 So, we fell back to open loop control of the modulator duty cycle and the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

, which isolates the modulator accumulator from the bellows at times when
 pressure change is not desired.
 In this application, the bi-directional isolation of the fuel injector
 valves is essential.

Unless the attractor is to change position, then the locking valve is closed,

 After 10 s, the locking valve closes, the modulator valve turns off, and

 Unfortunately, we were able to trace a systematic signal to the encoder.

 in the attractor position system comes from the pulse-width modulation
 system itself.
 The modulation valve and the locking valve are not coordinated at timescales
 comparable to the modulation frequency, so the locking valve shuts off
 in different parts of the modulation every Foil Flatnesstime.
 Therefore, the attractor stops in a slightly different location on every

 This dominates the position scatter in attractor position for each

On longer timescales, the fluctuation of atmospheric pressure is important.
 The precision regulator that feeds the gas handling system is referenced
 to atmospheric pressure.
 The attractor flexure, on the other hand, is controlled by the pressure
 relative to vacuum.
 As the gas-handling system is nothing but a fancy pressure division device,
 the open-loop duty-cycle control of the modulation rides along the carrier
 of atmospheric pressure.
 This effect can be seen in Fig.
 XXXRC, where runs at constant duty cycle fluctuate slightly in absolute
 position.
 This effect limited how close we could reliably operate the attractor to
 the foil over long periods of time with a simple control strategy; if the
 attractor hits the foil, at least an hour of data are lost (see

 through a 90/10 fiber coupler (ThorLabs FC1310-70-10-APC).
 The light that travels down the 90% branch is absorbed by an intensity
 monitor photodiode.
 The remaining 10% is coupled into a fiber that goes to the apparatus.
 The end of the fiber is carefully directed and positioned next to the isolating
 foil.
 Approximately 4% of the light leaving the fiber is reflected from the glass/vac

\begin_layout Standard
In order for the intensity values measured at the photodiode to be meaningful,
 we must develop an intensity-change to displacement conversion.
 As the intensity at the output port varies sinusoidally with foil position,
 the sensitivity of the instrument is spatially-varying.
 With the initial visible-light laser, we attempted to lock the fringe phase
 into the location of maximum sensitivity by varying the laser temperature
 temperature, and hence frequency.
 With the infrared distributed-feedback laser, the temperature coefficient
 is so small that such an approach cannot work.
 Future versions of the experiment may include positioning feedback for
 the fiber mount in order to maximize sensitivity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Determining fringe contrast can be done by displacing the foil.
 The attractor can be pressed into the foil by lightly over-driving the
 translation stage.
 If valves are manipulated to permit a slow retreat of the attractor (or
 using the very slow leak of the isolation valve), a fringe pattern may
 be obtained, as in Fig.

As it is challenging to infer anything about foil motion near a fringe turning
 point, we don't.
 We only consider times when the interferometer was in the middle 71% (
\begin_inset Formula $\sin(\pi/4)=\sqrt{2}/2=0.707$
\end_inset

) of the range of fringe contrast.
 Over the same range, the slope of the fringe-to-displacement sinusoid varies
 by at most 21% away from the mean (average slope 
\begin_inset Formula $2\sqrt{2}/\pi$
\end_inset

, maximum 1, minimum 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}/2$
\end_inset

 ).
 As we are only interested in an estimate (and hopefully an upper bound)
 on the foil's contribution to pendulum torque, this will be sufficient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within this range, we use the approximation 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\pi\lambda}{8\sqrt{2}A_{0}}\sim\frac{370\mbox{ nm}}{\mbox{fringe (peak-to-peak) }}$

 to convert measured output to displacement.

At sub-Hz frequencies, noise in the interferometer is believed to be polarizatio

 Differential stress in optical fibers can rotate the polarization throughout
 the entire Bloch sphere 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "ThorlabsPolarizationControl,ulrich1980bending,ross1984rotation"

\end_inset

.
 As the light emitted from the laser is, in general, polarized, the beamsplitter
 is likely to be polarization-sensitive, and the cavity and detector may
 have some polarization sensitivity, any change in polarization throughout
 the fibers may yield changing results.
 The effect of simply jostling the fiber is easily noted in the readout
 of the apparatus; listening to the photodiode output with headphones yields
 a siren-like tone, giving extra credence to the polarization-rotation explanati
on of the noise.
 Securing the fiber, where possible, to immovable objects with tape yielded
 a substantial improvement in sub-Hz noise.
 Noise from within the science run is plotted in Fig.

Great care was exercised in the design of the data acquisition system.
 In order to prevent any correlation of attractor-related information with

 computer.
 The computers shared only one ground, starred out from the main grounding
 block (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 While the interferometer readout could have been done by the pendulum control
 computer, it was convenient to use a third computer, with its own data-acquisit
ion board.
 The data were acquired from these three machines in parallel, each with
 their own clock.
 The timing system was arranged to synchronize all three computer clocks

 This became a major experimental concern, as we had no built-in synchronization

 for synchronization.
 A future iteration of this experiment must have an external clock sending
 optical pulses to all three DAQ systems.

 The vacuum pumping system was electrically isolated by a ceramic vacuum
 break above the turbo pump.
 In-vacuum electrical components which required a floating ground were floated
 and had signal grounds attached outside the apparatus.
 Control of the pendulum feedback electrodes was done using battery-powered
 instrumentation amplifiers placed just outside the apparatus in order to
 simplify grounding to a comprehensible few-component arrangement.
 The connection from the pneumatic drive to the experiment passed through
 a short section of plastic tubing.
 The foil interferometer readout is, beautifully, entirely optical; the
 nearest electronic components were more than a meter from the apparatus.

For the thermal tests, our group's custom wireless XBee sensor readout systems

 Microscopically, there is only one form of gas damping - collisions between
 gas particles and an oscillator allow momentum and energy exchange.
 Experimentally, when the particle mean free path is larger than the dimensions
 of the chamber, gas damping appears in two forms: 'free' damping and 'proximity

 Free gas damping is independent of an oscillator's location in a vacuum
 chamber, and depends only upon properties of the gas and the dimensions

Ground motion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several ways in which ground motion can cause an apparent pendulum
 torque:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Rotation of the ground: This rotates the instrument relative to the pendulum
 and appears as a spurious torque.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
'Tilt feedthrough': Asymmetry in the fiber cross-section converts the tilt
 of the fiber support into a pendulum twist.
 This is suppressed, but not eliminated, by the fiber 'prehanger'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Magnetic damper asymmetry: If the field of the swing damper is inhomogeneous,
 and the prehanger mass has a magnetic moment, damper swing will be converted
 to a torque.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Vertical bouncing: up-down motion of the pendulum changes the tensile stress
 in the fiber.
 There is a connection between fiber stress and equilibrium position, so
 vertical shaking may give rise to apparent torques.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Electrostatic interaction with nearby surfaces: For PlateWash, and most
 short-range experiments, this is the dominant effect.
 Asymmetric position-dependent pendulum interactions with the foil, control
 electrodes, and nearby grounded surfaces easily create powerful torques
 on the pendulum.
 Careful minimization of contact potentials is essential to reduce tilt/swing
 couplings.

Tilt
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effects of tilt are functionally indistinguishable from other ground
 motion in PlateWash.
 Qualititatively, we expect ground rotation to be our dominant source of
 external noise at sub-mHz frequencies.
 As an example, on sunny days, we can see the deformation of the building
 at sunrise as the upper part of our laboratory wall is differentially heated
 by the sun.
 Tilt is also the experiment's strongest coupling to human activity.
 Walking up to the apparatus deforms the floor, leading somehow through
 the instrument to a tilt coupling.
 When initially characterizing the apparatus, we took care to separate this
 effect from gravity by suspending a ~40
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

kg lead mass from our laboratory crane: lifting the mass only a millimeter
 off the floor was sufficient to produce an instrument response comparable
 to that seen from body weight.
 Lifting it higher had negligible effect.
 As with many of our external sources of noise, tilt noise in the lab is
 least at night, giving us a daily 6-8

Connection to contact potential
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As elucidated above, the electrostatic environment near the pendulum is
 important to these vibrational noise sources.
 The largest and closest surface to the pendulum is the foil.
 Minimizing the pendulum-foil contact potential, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{PF}$
\end_inset

, can have considerable impact on pendulum noise.
 Because of a non-constant contact potential as a function of pendulum angle,
 we were unable to trim 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{PF}$
\end_inset

 as well as should be possible in principle.
 Furthermore, as seen in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Capacitor-Systematic"

\end_inset

, we chose to give up control of 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{PF}$
\end_inset

 in order to eliminate a possible systematic effect.
 With further investigation, the systematic was traced to a bypass capacitor.
 Direct grounding of the foil is no longer required, and we will re-enable
 the

 control.
 Future pendulum designs and future iterations of this experiment must minimize

The PlateWash apparatus is sensitive to temperature.
 The fiber's equilibrium position and drift rate are perhaps most temperature

 To limit the effects of temperature variation, the instrument is located
 in a temperature controlled room.
 The room temperature varies by less than 1 degree through the year and
 <0.2 degrees daily.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As passive isolation, the vacuum system is an excellent insulator, with
 a time constant of about a week XXXMA for the internal aluminum baseplate
 with respect to the outside world.
 As further, rather limited, insulation, the clean-room fans are turned
 off during measurement periods, trapping a volume of air around the apparatus.

Instrumental noise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many electronic effects can create excess noise.
 Most pick-up effects are indistinguishable from autocollimator noise.
 Because PlateWash normally operates in electrostatic feedback, there is
 a second channel through which EMF pickup, ground loops, and finite digital-to-
analog conversion noise can couple to the pendulum.
 These effects may be assessed by comparing the pendulum noise with and
 without the feedback electrodes grounded.
 No excess noise was seen.

Any effect that is not directly related to attractor motion, but is aware

 In general, these systematics are very important in many experiments.

 The valve is positioned downstream of the electronic pressure gauge.
 The valve may be closed, and

Small non-uniformities in density of the attractor or pendulum materials

 The flat plate geometry of the experiment renders this effect largely second
 order.
 In the absence of an attractor non-uniformity, a pendulum void should be
 expected to have no effect at all.
 In the absence of a pendulum non-uniformity, an attractor void will cause
 a lateral position-dependent torque.
 If the attractor void were to occur near the outer corner of the pendulum

 In the event that two voids are laterally coincident, the maximum torque
 difference would be XXXRC N-m/(cubic micron of void).

Horizontal displacement of the pendulum is an excellent potential test for

Tilt/apparatus deformation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tilt sensitivity is a general affliction of torsion balances.
 Perhaps because of eccentricity of fine torsion fibers, all balances exhibit
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tilt feedthrough
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In short range interaction experiments, the tilt feedthrough is exacerbated
 by the importance of spatially varying electrostatic potentials.
 The apparatus has a two-axis tilt sensor, but it was intentionally turned
 off during data taking to minimize any electromagnetic interference.
 The pendulum autocollimator is sensitive along both vertical and horizontal
 axes, and provides a continuous measurement of pendulum tilt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Nonlinear tilt feedthrough
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The apparatus may have attractor-related tilt for a number of reasons, including
 the displacement of the center of mass of the attractor assembly, deformations
 of the attractor mount, and changing geometry of the attractor air line.
 The flexure was mounted from its center in order to minimize any deformation
 of the apparatus as a whole.
 The deflection is expected to be both small and linear, limiting the impact
 on the measurement.
 We initially estimated the effect of tilt by considering only center of
 mass motion, finding ~XXXRC N-m
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Flexure non-linearity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One interesting systematic effect that can exhibit considerable nonlinearity
 is the nonlinearity of the flexure itself.
 Most tilt-related effects are essentially blind to the attractor-foil distance.
 In order to maximise our use of the flexure's limited (<2mm) travel, the
 flexure's internal travel limit was located not far from the point at which
 the attractor pressed hard into the foil.
 If the double-compensating mechanism of the flexure experiences nonlinear
 stress near the (artificially-placed with mechanical stops) end of its
 travel, nonlinear stresses might be communicated to the baseplate.
 By looking at the nonlinearity of the vertical axis of the pendulum output,
 we can constrain the nonlinearity to XXXRC, yielding a torque of XXXRC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Magnetism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Magnetic systematics are among the most difficult to assess in these experiments.
 The foil provides limited, if any, shielding against low frequency magnetic
 fields.
 Because of the considerable strength of the magnetic interaction, great
 care must be taken to ensure that magnetic effects do not mimic or mask
 a gravitational signal.
 For the shortest-range effects, the torsion balance may be the most sensitive
 probe for their existence, complicating things considerably.
 Short range gravity research is becoming increasingly sophisticated in
 this realm; previous tests have only considered some of these effects.

If impurities are sufficiently numerous, then their presence will only appear

 the position on the autocollimator recorded, see Fig.

 to the attractor using a combination of the autocollimator readout and
 a measurement of the attractor-foil capacitance.
 Gross alignment was done by hand.
 Fine adjustment was done using the Belleville washers on the foil mount.
 When optical alignment reached XXXRC

Cleaning

\begin_layout Standard
Once the attractor and foil were aligned, it was essential to remove any
 debris/dust in the gap between them.
 To characterize the amount of dust in the gap, and to verify alignment,
 the attractor-foil capacitance was measured as a function of attractor
 position, including positions where the attractor touched the foil.
 Touching was, at this step, determined by noting the position where the
 capacitance reading became unreliable.
 The maximum capacitance recorded without signs of touching gave a proxy
 for the minimum attractor-foil separation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The attractor assembly was removed and the attractor face cleaned with isopropan
ol, clean room wipes, and dry nitrogen.
 The same was done with the attractor side of the foil.
 Both attractor and foil were visually inspected for dust.
 The attractor assembly was replaced against the registry blocks and re-clamped.
 The attractor-foil capacitance was measured as a function of attractor
 position.
 The cleaning procedure was repeated until no gains in capacitance were
 observed with subsequent cleanings.

The critical distances between and relative orientations of the pendulum,

 A number of methods were explored, but the method of choice was as follows:
 The freely twisting pendulum was allowed to tap the foil as the attractor
 was pressed into the foil by the flexure stage.
 As the attractor displaced the foil, the angular amplitude of the tapping
 signal necessarily decreased to zero.
 The point where this occurred was used as a reference to determine the
 absolute distance between the pendulum and the attractor

A second benefit to small 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is the increased number of independent measurements.
 This experiment relies on Monte Carlo-like measurement schemes (random
 attractor locations) to understand systematic uncertainties and better
 constrain possible violations of the ISL.
 Faster individual measurements allow faster exploration of parameter space
 (exploring a 
\begin_inset Formula $6\times6$
\end_inset

 grid of measurements requires a day with the current choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $t$

 Measurements that are twice as fast allow twice as many questions to be
 answered.
 At equal noise levels, there is no penalty for this approach.

Choosing a frequency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the first harmonic is the only signal of importance (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Harmonics"

\end_inset

), we should place the first harmonic at the location of lowest noise (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Experimentally-determined-noise"

\end_inset

).
 Furthermore, we are driven by statistics (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Statistics"

\end_inset

) to operate at the highest practical frequency.
 The required use of lags to eliminate systematic uncertainties places a
 soft upper bound on usable frequencies (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Lags"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The operating frequency was chosen well in advance of the science run reported
 here, before the instrument was fully understood.
 We selected a frequency that we expected would give low noise and was sufficien
tly slow to allow transients associated with attractor motion to damp.
 We selected 3.90625

 This choice improves the performance of discrete Fourier analysis and minimizes
 beating between signal and sample frequencies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Choosing a science signal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the pendulum is locked in feedback, there are multiple data channels
 that may be used to extract a science measurement.
 The pendulum twist angle, the feedback signal itself, and the P, I, and
 D terms of the feedback loop are written to disk.
 The pendulum twist angle and the P (proportional) term of the loop are
 necessarily equivalent.
 In practice, the twist signal and P term were anti-aliased differently.
 The P term had an 5
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s filter applied, making it the signal of choice for a twist measurement.
 The loop was operated with zero I-term, so the I channel contains no signal.
 The D (derivative) term responds like 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

, making it unsuited to low frequency signal extraction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, there are two reasonable science channels: the feedback signal applied
 to the pendulum, and the P term.
 The feedback signal has units of torque, the P term has units of angle.
 Even though the pendulum is held fixed, the torque-angle transfer function
 remains important.
 At frequencies below the resonance of the pendulum, the two channels are
 directly proportional.
 At frequencies above resonance, the frequency-independent angle noise of
 the autocollimator appears, in the feedback signal, as torque noise that
 rises like frequency squared.
 As shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Fourier Harmonics"

\end_inset

, the higher harmonics of the attractor motion contain no interesting signal,
 so it is in our interest to low-pass them away.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By choosing the angle signal instead of the feedback signal as the science
 signal, we use the inertia of the pendulum as an analog low-pass filter.
 While, in principle, both signals contain the science, the science signal
 is more-easily extracted from the angle signal.
 Furthermore, as the feedback signal is the sum of the P and the derived
 D terms, there's less opportunity for an error to enter into the science
 signal if the measured angle is used alone.

Windowing is familiar to many as a method for reducing the magnitude of
 spectral leakage in Fourier transforms.
 It is also of use, as a low-pass filter, in reducing the sensitivity of
 an averaged value to high frequency fluctuations at a modest expense in
 statistical resolving power.
 In this analysis, a Hann window is used

 Just as in periodogram estimation, the choice

 Several windowing schemes were explored, without significant improvement.

Lock-in
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the lags are chosen, a window selected, and a leading edge found, locking
 in is straightforward.
 Beginning at a time prescribed by a leading edge, the analysis program
 walks through each data stream, multiplies the data found in each 'step
 period' (1/2 the attractor motion period) by the properly-lagged window
 function, and computes the weighted average.
 The resulting average forms a single measurement.

The first measurement, and every other subsequent measurement, is regarded

 The second measurement, and every other subsequent measurement (the complement

 Because the pneumatic drive takes about one attractor period to come into
 equilibrium (if coming from a different A/B position pair in the previous
 cut), the first A and B measurements are dropped from quantitative analysis.

 The fitting algorithm implements a binary search in frequency for the maximum
 fit amplitude present in the data.
 At present, there is no cycle-mark on the calibration attractor, so no
 attempt is made to match the phase of the fit with an external phase reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To remove transients before fitting, torque data are passed through a 'spikeRemo
ver', applied to the data's time derivative.
 As the calibration signal is continuous, transient signals are interpreted
 as spurious.
 Any 100 s region of data centered on a suspected spike is excised completely.
 Spike detection uses a an aggressive version of Chauvenet's criterion XXY

Attractor-correlated torque measurement

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The attractor moves every 128 s.
 After XXY s, the attractor is nearly stationary until its next movement.
 The science signal is the difference in torque on the pendulum between
 stationary steps.
 For narrowed bandwidth, we alternate 10 times between two states.
 This set of 20 (becomes 18 - see

In order to prevent the contamination of each bin by transient effects from

 each position change (XXY do I do this in seconds or samples? Does it matter?
 Does it beat?)

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Preventing the aliasing of high frequency noise into low frequency measurements
 is of particular importance to the PlateWash measurement.
 As the torsion balance operates in feedback, autocollimator noise, (white
 in angle), rises like 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{2}$
\end_inset

 in torque.
 As an simple anti-aliasing measure, the data within each accepted bin are
 multiplied by a parabolic (Welch) window function before averaging.
 To preserve normalization, the weights are independently accumulated, and
 the ratio of accumulated weighted data to accumulated weight is the reported
 average for each bin.

\begin_layout Standard
A clear method of visualization is important to understanding the output
 of any experiment.
 For PlateWash, the natural plot is three-dimensional.
 The experiment measures the difference in pendulum torque between two different
 attractor positions.
 So, if we plot 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau(\mbox{start},\mbox{end})$
\end_inset

, we can plot every measurement in the experiment in a single plot, as in
 Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "TriangleScatterPlot"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three dimensional plots are difficult to read, three dimensional plots with
 errorbars are worse.
 Furthermore, the scatter in a plot like Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "TriangleScatterPlot"

\end_inset

 is dominated by the noisiest points.
 As shown in (plot of noise vs.
 time), the noise in PlateWash varies by orders of magnitude with environmental
 conditions; we're interested mostly in the points with least scatter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to present the result in a meaningful and two-dimensional way,
 the 'triangle plot' was developed.
 In order to improve the statistics by a factor of two, we make the assumption
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau(a,b)=\Delta\tau(b,a)$
\end_inset

, and fold the points over the 
\begin_inset Formula $a=b$
\end_inset

 axis.
 In order to plot points with uncertainties, measurements are plotted as
 circles in the 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b$
\end_inset

 plane.
 The magnitude of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

 is represented by the radius of the circle.
 To provide an errorbar, the region from 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau+\sigma_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau-\sigma_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 is plotted in grey.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau-\sigma_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $|\Delta\tau+\sigma_{\tau}|$
\end_inset

 are greater than zero (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 a point is off-zero with 1-
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 significance), the remainder of the circle is filled in with color.
 To represent the sign of the datapoint, yellow is negative, and blue is
 positive XXXRC (check sign).
 Any force of nature should satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau(a,a)=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 Any conservative force should be associative: 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau(a,c)=\Delta\tau(a,b)+\Delta\tau(b,c)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This method has limitations.
 Large signals, or large uncertainties produce large circles, which can
 hide smaller, more significant, points.
 For sparsely sampled data, however, it can be very helpful.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Bootstrap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis presented here makes extensive use of a statistical method
 called 'the bootstrap' or 'bootstrapping'.
 Its primary merit in this context is that it allows straightforward and
 reasonably robust estimation of confidence intervals.
 Its support rests upon the premise that the best estimator for the distribution
 from which a data set is drawn is the data set itself.
 The idea is to 'resample' the data to create synthetic data sets which
 may be passed through any analysis routine developed for the original data
 set.
 With repetition, this process generates distributions of important output
 quantities (best-fit points in 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha-\lambda$
\end_inset

 space, for example) without recourse to complex error estimation/propagation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resampling scheme used in this analysis was to replace a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $1/e$
\end_inset

 of the data points in a data set with others randomly selected from the
 initial data set.
 There is a related class of methods called 'the jackknife' that generate
 statistics by considering complete sets of subsets of data.

In addition to extracting model parameters from the data, we can reconstruct
 the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(d)$
\end_inset

, the pendulum torque as a function of attractor/pendulum separation.
 The entire data set consists of differential measurements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(d)$
\end_inset

, where the attractor measures a 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau=\tau(d_{1})-\tau(d_{2})$
\end_inset

 Recovering

 is then similar to recovering a function using knowledge of its derivative.

\end_inset

 and those computed using the fitting function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau_{fit}$

 To provide confidence intervals on the fit parameters, we bootstrap the
 measured data many times; the distribution of the extracted fit parameters
 provides the necessary foundation.

Blindness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most accurate experiments are free of bias.
 It is possible to perform an unbiased experiment without a blind, but it
 is difficult to guarantee that all pre-concieved notions of experimental
 results and implications are suppressed.
 Critics of blind experiments claim that, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no experiment is truly blind,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in reference to the current reality that experimenters unblind their results
 prior to peer review and submission for publication.
 This is true, but it hides the power of the blind -- forcing complete and
 equal attention to each 
\emph on
known
\emph default
 systematic effect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PlateWash is not a blind experiment.
 It is a precursor to a blind experiment.
 More than half of the science data were taken without a blind, largely
 because we had not discovered a way to monitor the health of the experiment
 without access to data which included the central values of each measurement.
 In the latter half of science data-taking, it became clear that watching
 the errorbars on each cut was sufficient to ensure data quality.
 In this first iteration of PlateWash, our understanding of the instrument's
 metrology was in continuous refinement, which frustrated any attempt to
 inject a fake signal into the data as they were acquired.
 (Furthermore, the physical separation between pendulum and attractor DAQ
 systems would make doing so extremely difficult).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis proceeded as if it were blind, to demonstrate the suitability
 of the analysis toolchain for a future blind analysis.

 Furthermore, code can be maintained seamless in multiple branches, preventing
 speculative work from stepping on main-line production work.
 Git was designed from the start to be distributed.
 Anyone working on the project has a complete copy of the project source;
 it's effectively a distributed backup.
 This project is hosted on github, in addition to several machines at CENPA.
 Git is perhaps the de-facto standard in the software industry for source
 code managment.

Assorted GNU/Unix tools
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The benevolent computer engineers of yore have left us many gifts.
 This thesis relies heavily upon bash, awk, sed, grep, and many other tools
 of the standard UNIX command set.
 While these tools may appear cryptic or antiquated to a young physicist,
 they're very powerful.
 All the problems smart people had in the 1970s are the same problems smart
 people have now.
 The benefit is that the smart people in the past have left us their tools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bash is the scripting language for a standard UNIX shell (and the name of
 the shell itself).
 Awk is designed for handling tabular arrays of data of all kinds.
 It is fast and flexible.
 Sed, the 'string editor', is a tool designed for rapidly traversing text
 files and operating on them; think of it as find-and-replace on steroids.

 included as a child document into the LyX/LaTeX document.
 Voilà, data analysis flows directly into text!

For the last months of this analysis, the data analysis and thesis were
 rebuilt from scratch hourly.
 This enables quick catching of integration bugs and allows collaborators
 to contribute to any part of the work at any time.
 Furthermore, frequent builds provide a clear picture of the deliverable
 state of the project.
 For a blinded experiment with an automated unblinding procedure, this is
 essential.
 A primitive bug-tracking system allowed quantitative tracking of progress.

This project has insufficient testing coverage.
 This is under continuous improvement, but our first results must be delivered
 before testing coverage is complete.
 Our most sincere apologies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unit tests are used to verify that each individual library in a project
 delivers the expected output.
 If individual program units have failings, it is impossible for an assembly
 of those program units not to contain failures.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Testing is perhaps best explained by example.
 In our field, it is customary for everyone to regard the normalization
 of any FFT program as suspect until proven otherwise.
 One of the standard checks is to verify that the integrated real-space
 power and the integrated Fourier-space power are equal.
 People usually try a few inputs until they're approximately satisfied that
 the results behave as expected.
 What if that were programatic? If, before you made serious use of a library,
 you could hit 'test', and the software could run a predefined set of such
 tests.
 It is 
\emph on
much
\emph default
 easier to check whether a test is written correctly than it is to verify
 that code is correctly-written.
 Testing is a requisite part of quality software development, and data analysis
 is software.

\begin_layout Standard
It is further possible to do

 As a partial check, many of the plots rendered throughout this thesis will
 allow the reader to verify that the analysis is approximately correct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Octave has a very handy syntax for integrating unit tests into functions.

While the

 geometry affords us many luxuries of alignment, where many corrections
 to gravitational imperfections in the basic setup are second-order, it
 is essential to have the ability to simulate the forces and torques between
 arbitrary mass configurations.
 Furthermore, the calculations must be sufficiently simple that they may
 be easily audited.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While it is less computationally-efficient, and can have numerical rounding
 concerns, we have chosen to simulate the Newtonian signals in PlateWash
 by breaking field and test masses into aggregations of many small point
 masses and computing the simple sums of forces and torques between them.
 Done this way, there is only the inverse square law to implement correctly.

Superposition

\begin_layout Standard
The planar sheets utilize a critical principle of superposition.
 In the region where the pendulum-attractor separation is comparable to
 the grid spacing, any pointwise calculation of forces and torques is almost
 guaranteed to be erroneous or require careful attention.
 This difficulty can be bypassed entirely by superposition.
 The gravitational field from a cylindrical sheet can be computed either
 directly, or by computing the force from a large annulus that represents
 the

missing

\end_inset

 mass from an infinite sheet that the cylindrical sheet purports to represent
 and subtracting it from the known-uniform force due to an infinite sheet.

Prior to the development of this Newtonian modelling package, Matt Turner
 developed an independent package for computing the PlateWash torques using
 a semi-analytic numerical approach.
 These results were found to be in agreement with this simulation package
 for all pendulum/attractor combinations attempted.

 Much of the light should make only one reflection.
 While only 4% of the reflected light re-couples into the fiber-optic core,
 much of it should couple back into the fiber cladding dissipate elsewhere.
 Nonetheless, the few microwatts that must be dissipated through conduction
 in the foil may contribute to a slight foil temperature rise.
 To test for any related systematic effect, in runs XXXRC, we operated the
 attractor in the XXXRC stroke mode with the interferometer laser turned
 off.
