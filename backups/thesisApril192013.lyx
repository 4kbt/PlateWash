Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not every thesis requires introduction.
 For reasons which will hopefully become clear, this one does.
 The experimental challenges that shaped the design, implementation, analysis,
 and results of the PlateWash experiment should be introduced even before
 we begin.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The motivation for this experiment is simple.
 Nobody knows what gravity does over distances shorter than ~100 microns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Newtonian theory of gravity, and its refinement General Relativity,
 agree with every experimental test yet completed.
 Using these theories, we have considerable predictive power, particularly
 for orbital mechanics.
 These theories are mathematically incompatible with the 
\emph on
exceedingly
\emph default
 well-tested theory of the Standard Model.
 An important example: There is no quantum mechanics in the theory of gravity.
 New theories that attempt to resolve this tension tend to predict novel
 behavior of gravity over short distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The forces with which we are concerned are small -- ~50 fN.
 On the scale of modern gravitational experiment, however, they're somewhat
 large; our group's equivalence principle measurements measure forces on
 similar masses that are 100 times smaller.
 So, the primary task is not to prove that such an experiment is sufficiently
 sensitive, but rather to prove that we're not seeing or hiding a Standard
 Model background that mimics gravity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This experiment is complimentary to our group's world-leading short-range
 gravity test.

Motivation and Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Four fundamental interactions are known.
 In historical order of characterization, they are gravity, which governs
 planetary motions; electromagnetism, which describes the interactions of
 electrically charged objects, and the weak force and strong forces, which
 govern nuclear and subnuclear dynamics.
 The electric and weak forces were unified theoretically by XXX as the electrowe
ak interaction in XXX.
 The strong force is described well by quantum chromodynamics.
 The resulting theory of the electroweak and the strong, precisely tested,
 finely tuned, and quantum in nature, is known as the Standard Model.
 Einstein's theory of gravity, general relativity, is consistent with all
 precision tests, but it contains no known links to the Standard Model.
 For interactions with sufficiently high energy density, one or both theories
 must fail, as they predict different phenomena.
 (XXX)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Standard Model is a triumph.
 It is a complex theory, with 18 or more parameters (particle masses, coupling
 constants, and mixing parameters) which are tuned to fit observation.
 After tuning, the Model has predictive power, correctly recovering within
 experimental and theoretical error the known zoo of observed particles,
 resonances, and phenomena, with very few exceptions.
 The exceptions are, therefore, very important.
 The Standard Model has one major remaining prediction - the existence of
 the so-called Higgs boson, a lynchpin for the theory, which may have been
 discovered at the LHC in 2012 XXX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Observations which the Standard Model cannot explain:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gravity: There is no coupling between uncharged objects in the Standard
 Model.
 Furthermore, on a charge for charge basis, the interactions in the Standard
 Model are 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{46}$
\end_inset

 XXX times stronger than gravity, frustrating any unification attempts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Neutrino mass, oscillation: The Standard Model admits only massless left-handed
 neutrinos, yet they are observed to have a small but very significant,
 mass.
 Furthermore, the mass and flavor eigenstates of the neutrino are not the
 same.
 This could be accommodated by adding the neutrino mixing angles to the
 list of tuning parameters, but it was not anticipated by anything within
 the

 theory XXX.

\begin_layout Standard
The Cosmological Constant Problem/Dark Energy: Astronomical observations
 suggest that the universe is expanding, and doing so at a rate which is
 increasing XXX.
 The phenomenon can be explained by proposing the existence of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Dark Energy
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, an energy density associated with empty space, that has negative pressure.
 The energy density of vacuum, as described by the Standard Model, is

Dark Matter: Beginning with the study of galactic rotation curves, a compelling
 body of observations point toward the existence of a novel form of matter,
 perhaps a new family of particles, that, at accessible temperatures, couples

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, the angular power spectra of the cosmic microwave background,
 along with detailed studies of nucleosynthesis, are highly compatible with
 cosmology theory that includes dark energy and cold dark matter and are
 essentially incompatible with theories that do not (XXX WMAP).
 These measurements suggest a dark energy density of XXX keV/cm

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Newton proposed the gravitational inverse square law in 16XX in order to
 explain the motions of celestial bodies.
 He suggested that the gravitational force between two objects is always
 attractive, is proportional to the mass of each object, and inversely proportio
nal to the square of the distance between them.
 This model was remarkably good at predicting the motion of celestial orbits,
 the tides, and gave the first quantitative value for the mass of the Earth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
XXX Did Newton also compute the strength at Earth's surface? Was it empirical,
 or did he invoke a dimensionality argument?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The inverse square law (ISL) for gravity has been subjected to many experimental
 and astronomical tests.
 The observed stability of elliptical orbits and the apparent validity of
 Kepler's laws gave immediate support to the theory at solar system scales.
 The first laboratory test of the ISL was done by Cavendish and XXX in XXX
 in support of his measurement of the density of the Earth.
 See a fine review by Fischbach for the history of these experiments XXX.
 Current tests of the inverse square law are underway at the University
 of Washington XXX, Huazhong University, University of Indiana, Washington
 University at St.
 Louis, Stanford University, Apache Point Observatory, XXX Clive Speake,
 Dusseldorf University, and XXX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Early tests of the inverse square law parametrized possible inverse square
 law violations as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F_{G}\propto\frac{1}{r^{2+\epsilon}},
\]

\end_inset

 and set bounds on the size of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

.
 This parametrization is hard to reconcile with modern theory, as there
 are no known viable theories that propose fractional dimensions at all
 scales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In modern work, proposed inverse square law violations are parametrized
 as forces mediated by an exchange particle.
 For both scalar and vector particles XXX, when the fields are weak, the
 modified potential takes the form 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V(r)=-G\frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r}(1+\alpha e^{-r/\lambda}),\label{eq:YukawaPotential}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the new interaction's strength relative to gravity and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is the interaction's characteristic length (usually the reduced Compton
 wavelength of a mediating particle with mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\hbar/mc$
\end_inset

 XXX).
 This is not the only possible modified potential, but it is general and
 has become a traditional parametrization for inverse square law violations.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
String Theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
String theory provided the catalyst for a resurgence of interest in the
 inverse square law at sub-millimeter scales in the late 1990s.
 At the cost of as many as seven extra dimensions, the theory offers a the
 promise of unifying gravity with the other forces.
 The extra dimensions are hidden away from normal observation with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compactification
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; the introduction of a scale shorter than which extra dimensions are relevant
 to particle interactions and longer than which any effects of extra dimensions
 are suppressed.
 Critically, the effects of gravity would be sensitive to the change in
 dimensionality by obeying Gauss' Law at all scales - diluting gravity into
 the many extra dimensions at short distances, while diluting into only
 three spatial dimensions at longer scales.
 String theories predict that gravity will get significantly more attractive
 at scales shorter than the compactification scale.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If parametrized as a particle-exchange theory, string theory predicts two
 new types of exchange particles, known as the dilaton and the radion.
 Both would appear gravitationally as Yukawa violations of the inverse square
 law at scales comparable to the compactification length.
 The dilaton is responsible for the familiar Gauss' law increase in strength
 of gravity, while the radion is associated with excitations of the periodic
 spacetime normally accorded to the compactified dimensions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, the compactification scales are quite small, 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-XXX}$

 It was shown in 1997 XXX by ADD that, using the then-current limits on
 the gravitational inverse square law, the compactification scale of one
 or more of these extra dimensions could be as large as a millimeter or
 more.

\begin_layout Subsection
Dark Energy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At present, the dominant motivation for submillimeter gravity tests comes
 from the physics of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dark energy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The universe has been observed to be expanding through redshift, CMB, structure
, and other measurements.
 Not only is the expansion occurring, but the expansion rate is observed
 to be accelerating throughout the visible historical record in astronomical
 observations.
 The expansion and changes in its rate can be roughly explained if there
 is an energy density 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 associated with a volume of spacetime and if this new kind of energy has
 negative pressure.
 If measured in accordance with the usual FRW parametrization, XXX ...

If the supernova measurements are used to extract a value for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$

.
 If this is converted to a length using Planck's constant and the speed
 of light, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda=\sqrt[4]{\frac{\hbar c}{\Lambda}}\approx86\,\mu\mbox{m}.
\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
XXX If there is new gravitational physics associated with Dark Energy, we
 should expect interesting behavior at this approximate spatial scale.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Cosmological Constant
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps closely related to the dark energy problem is an older problem in
 physics.
 In the Einstein Equations for unperturbed spacetime, XXX, there is a free
 parameter, 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

, which plays the same (XXX 0 or 1?) role as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 in the evolution of spacetime.
 Very roughly, it is the energy density associated with a volume of space.
 If computed from modern particle theory, the expectation is that 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{ParticleTheory}\sim10^{120}C_{Observed}$
\end_inset

 XXX.
 Without a physically-motivated infrared cutoff to the necessary integrals,
 there is no known explanation for this discrepancy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any deviation, particularly a weakening, of gravity at short range might
 provide the clues needed to explain this major theoretical problem.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $C\leftrightarrow\Lambda$
\end_inset

, then the motivation for submillimeter gravitational experiments is necessarily
 stronger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Fat Graviton
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Randall Sundrum (XXX is his name Randall?) showed in XXX that the Cosmological
 Constant problem could be resolved if gravity were to become significantly
 weaker at scales below 100 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m.
 His 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fat graviton
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 modification of gravity is remarkable because he predicts that it must
 occur at scales greater than 20 microns.
 Experimental attempts to constrain the interaction [XXX] have adopted the
 functional form 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{12}(r)=-G\frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}[1-e^{-(0.914\frac{r}{l_{g}})^{3}}]$
\end_inset

 after Figure 8 in Sundrum's paper.
 Present bounds on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Chameleons
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
XXX, XXX, and Nelson noted in XXX that the simple addition of a self-interacting
 term to the Lagrangian to any new interaction could hide it from long range
 experimental searches.
 Self interactions act to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

screen
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the effect of any new interaction.
 As self-interaction is a general property of fields, the notion is quite
 reasonable.
 In its simplest form as a scalar field, XXX (Lagrangian), a chameleon interacti
on must be constrained by limiting not only the exchange particle's mass
 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 but also the self interaction strength 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.
 Because chameleon interactions are self-screening, the screening length
 XXX becomes the relevant length scale at which the new interaction may
 emerge from camoflage.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to their physical motiviation, chameleon interactions are ready-made
 to evade traditional inverse square law tests.
 All precision tests of short-range gravity at gravitational strength to
 date, including the experiment described here, make use of an isolating
 metal foil between the source and detector masses.
 Because of XXX, the isolating foil significantly enhances the effective
 self-screening of the chameleon interaction.
 When searching for this class of interactions, the isolating material must
 be made as thin as possible, or dispensed with entirely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Unparticles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Weinberg kicked off a flurry of theoretical work by noting the possibility
 of interactions with novel dispersion relations, where the particle propagator
 was XXX instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{k^{2}+m^{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 Unparticle interactions would appear in tests of short range gravity by
 XXX.
 The existing body of inverse square law tests served to place the most
 stringent constraints on XXX.
 The tight constraints, on new theory, that stem from precision tests of
 gravity are the guaranteed payoff that come with incremental improvement
 in the laboratory.

\begin_layout Standard
Tests of gravity using test bodies with known masses have now spanned about
 thirty orders of magnitude in spatial extent.
 Gravity itself has been observed consistent with an inverse square law
 over the roughly sixteen orders of magnitude from the solar system scale
 down to the size of a human hair.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Precision measurements of the distance dependence of gravity may have begun
 with Kepler.
 Kepler's Laws [XXX] are now taught to students as necessary corrolaries
 of Newton's theory, but Kepler's data were essential to the formulation
 of the theory itself [XXX].
 Astronomical tests of gravity remain the most precise, providing direct
 tests of General Relativity in addition to Newton's Laws.
 In order of decreasing range and increasing precision, the currently leading
 solar system tests of gravity are the Pioneer spacecraft [XXX], the Cassini
 mission to Saturn [XXX], radar ranging to Mars [XXX], and the very precise
 lunar laser ranging [XXX].
 The lunar results are, up to any theoretical uncertainties in the complicated
 astronomical modeling code, by far the most precise tests of gravity.
 The experimental data are consistent with the inverse square law at the
 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-XXX}$
\end_inset

 level [XXX].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the laboratory, direct observations began with XXX and Cavendish with
 a torsion balance in XXX, observing gravity at scales of tens of centimeters
 to meters.
 Successive improvements on that method and tests with improved gravimeters
 have extended tests of gravity out to scales the size of Earth [XXX](XXX

 From scales of 10 cm out to XXX km, the leading direct measurements of

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At scales of approximately meters and below, tests of the inverse square
 law become more specialized.
 Experimental designs become more and more carefully crafted to suppress
 systematics that would otherwise hide the signature of gravity entirely.
 Prior to 2001, the shortest distance at which gravity had been observed
 was ~XXX, by Spero 
\emph on

 in 1980 XXX.
 This remains the best published limit from scales of XXX-XXX cm, though
 an improved result from XXX, Boynton, Newman, and collaborators is expected

Initially inspired by the suggestions of large extra dimensions, the Eot-Wash

 Most recently, there has been a new experiment from Huazhong University
 using a vertical torsion balance geometry that set an

 limit at

At distances shorter than

m (XXX) and longer than

 force.
 Any disagreement between observations of the Casimir force and the Casimir

 So far, no clear deviations have been observed, so the measurement uncertaintie

Principle - Gauss' Law Test

\begin_layout Standard
For Coulomb potentials, the field of an infinite sheet of charge is uniform.
 Its strength does not vary with distance from the sheet, nor does its direction.
 This is normally derived by making use of Gauss' law.
 Indeed, it may be shown that, in three dimensions, any force that obeys
 a 
\begin_inset Formula $1/r$
\end_inset

 potential satisfies Gauss' law XXX and vice versa XXX.
 Our experiment is a test of the uniformity of the gravitational field of

\begin_layout Standard
In its idealized form, our experiment compares the gravitational field strength
 at two distances from an infinite sheet of mass.
 Finite sheet masses are suspended on opposite sides of a torsion pendulum
 aligned parallel to their moment arms, but displaced in opposite directions
 perpendicular to the arms.
 If there is an inverse square law violating force between the sheets on
 the pendulum and an infinite sheet of matter, the pendulum will feel a
 torque.
 If the distance between the pendulum and the sheet is modulated, the torque
 will vary in sync with the modulation.
 If there are no inverse square law violating interactions between the pendulum
 and sheet, the pendulum will experience

 The difficulties in the measurement primarily involve ensuring that the

Foil Interferometer

\begin_layout Standard
The isolating foil is the most important defense against systematic error.
 It is a physical and electrical barrier between pendulum and attractor.
 If it moves in an attractor-correlated way, the pendulum's electrostatic
 environment will change.
 In order to assess the foil's motion, we built an interferometric optical
 sensor system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The foil interferometer is a Fizeau XXX (cite) interferometer.
 Inspired by the designs and sensitivities of early atomic force microscope
 (AFM) readout systems, the device interferes light from a reference surface
 and a reflecting target surface.
 In this case, the reference surface is the end of an optical fiber, and
 the reflecting target surface is the PlateWash isolating foil.
 As shown in Fig XXX, light from a fiber-coupled laser is directed through
 a 90/10 fiber coupler.
 The light that travels down the 90% branch is absorbed by an intensity
 monitor diode.
 The remaining 10% is coupled into a fiber that goes to the apparatus.
 The end of the fiber is carefully directed and positioned next to the isolating
 foil.
 Approximately 5% (XXX) of the light leaving the fiber is reflected from
 the glass/air interface.
 Due to the divergence of the beam (NA XXX, core diameter XXX), less light
 re-enters the fiber core after reflecting from the foil.
 By adjusting the fiber-foil distance, it is possible to tune the internally
 and externally-reflected light to have comparable intensity, maximizing
 the interference contrast.
 In PlateWash, the operating point is ~XXX
\backslash
pmXXX from the foil (can get it from the crash plot).

\begin_layout Standard
The reflected light returns down the fiber to the 90/10 splitter.

 is attenuated by a Faraday isolator.

In order for the intensity values measured at the photodiode to be meaningful,
 we must develop an intensity-change to displacement conversion.
 As the intensity at the output port necessarily varies sinusoidally with
 foil position, the sensitivity .
 With the initial visible-light laser, we attempted to lock the fringe phase
 into the location of maximum sensitivity by varying the laser temperature
 temperature, and hence frequency.
 With the infrared distributed feedback laser, the temperature coefficient
 is so small that such an approach cannot work.
 Future versions of the experiment may include positioning feedback for
 the fiber mount in order to maximize sensitivity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Determining fringe contrast can only be done by displacing the foil.
 The attractor can be pressed into the foil by lightly over-driving the

\begin_inset Formula $2\sqrt{2}/\pi$

, maximum 1, minimum 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}/2$
\end_inset

 ).
 As we are only interested in an estimate (and hopefully an upper bound)

 (XXX cite us and aggregation paper), torsion balances in imperfect vacuum
 are damped by the residual atmosphere.
 Microscopically, there is only one form of gas damping - collisions between
 gas particles and an oscillator allow momentum and energy exchange.
 Experimentally, when the particle mean free path is larger than the dimensions
 of the chamber, gas damping appears in two forms: 'free' damping and 'proximity
-enhanced' damping.
 Free gas damping is independent of an oscillator's location in a vacuum
 chamber, and depends only upon properties of the gas:

\begin_layout Standard
Proximity-enhanced gas damping is geometry dependent.
 It arises in regions of constrained gas flow.
 Restricted volumes of gas that are compressed/rarified by oscillator motion
 have slight over/under-pressure that opposes the oscillator's motion.
 If the restricted volume's equilibration time

 size of any metallic patches, we expect this effect to be important.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Estimating or measuring the size of this effect is a challenge.
 Our pendulums may be more sensitive to this effect than available Kelvin
 probes, it's difficult to compare with surface-physics experiments due
 to differing surface preparation and vacuum properties, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experimentally, all of our group's short-range experiments have seen increased
 noise at small separations.
 This is one of the boogey-men invoked to explain it.
 We generally see improved noise performance from newly-coated foils immediately
 after pump-down, but don't have a satisfactory understanding of the effect.

\begin_layout Standard
Electrical connections generally form small galvanic batteries.
 Numerous connections in series between, for example, the pendulum and foil

Autocollimator noise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The opto-electronic system used to measure pendulum twist has its own inherent
 noise.
 By design, the autocollimator's relatively white noise floor is chosen
 to sit below the low-frequency thermally-driven angle noise of XXX.
 The PlateWash autocollimator's noise floor is approximately XXX.
 XXX Fig.
 Because of the pendulum's 
\begin_inset Formula $1/f^{2}$
\end_inset

 response function at high frequency, angle readout noise is the primary
 limit on the instruments' torque sensitivity at high frequency.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Environment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A number of environmental factors can give rise to extra noise in the balance.
 Careful design and construction helps to limit these effects.
 Many of them are transient in nature, and may be avoided by focusing data
 acquisition into quite parts of the day, week, and year.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Ground motion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several ways in which ground motion can cause an apparent pendulum
 torque:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Rotation of the ground: This rotates the instrument relative to the pendulum
 and appears as a spurious torque.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
'Tilt feedthrough': Asymmetry in the fiber cross-section converts the tilt
 of the fiber support into a pendulum twist.
 This is suppressed, but not eliminated, by the fiber 'prehanger'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Magnetic damper asymmetry: If the field of the swing damper is inhomogeneous,
 and the prehanger mass has a magnetic moment, damper swing will be converted
 to a torque.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Vertical bouncing: up-down motion of the pendulum changes the tensile stress
 in the fiber.
 There is a connection between fiber stress and equilibrium position, so
 vertical shaking may give rise to apparent torques.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Electrostatic interaction with nearby surfaces: For PlateWash, and most
 short-range experiments, this is the dominant effect.
 Asymmetric position-dependent pendulum interactions with the foil, control
 electrodes, and nearby grounded surfaces easily create powerful torques
 on the pendulum.
 Careful minimization of contact potentials is essential to reduce tilt/swing
 couplings.
 XXX elaborate.
 With simple modification and bias voltages, the PlateWash balance can become
 a powerful tilt sensor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Seismic
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Earthquakes worldwide can affect the balance.
 Quakes of magnitude 3+ in the immediate region (Northern California to
 Alaska) can disturb operation for minutes to hours.
 Large quakes, such as the recent Chilean and Japanese quakes, disturb Earth
 so violently that it can take a day or more before aftershocks and low-frequenc
y modes of terrestrial vibration have damped.

Gravity gradients
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The majority of Eot-Wash XXX(umlaut) pendulums are designed to have vanishing
 low-order gravitational moments.
 PlateWash, on the other hand, has a sizeable 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{22}$
\end_inset

 moment (it's a flat plate, with masses on the end).
 Recent estimates by Krishna Venkateswara and Todd Wagner put the ambient
 gravitational gradient noise at approximately XXX.
 This noise level converts to torque noise of XXX.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Wind
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the coupling mechanism to wind is presumably seismic, tilt, gravitational
 gradient, or pressure-related, we don't know the cause.
 What is clear from our data is a strong coupling between outside wind and
 pendulum noise.
 Stormy periods can elevate torque noise by as much as an order of magnitude
 over completely still periods.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Connection to contact potential
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As elucidated above, the electrostatic environment near the pendulum is
 important to these vibrational noise sources.
 The largest and closest surface to the pendulum is the foil.
 Minimizing the pendulum-foil contact potential, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{PF}$
\end_inset

, can have considerable impact on pendulum noise.
 Because of a non-constant contact potential as a function of pendulum angle,
 we were unable to trim 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{PF}$
\end_inset

 as well as should be possible in principle.
 Furthermore, as seen in section XXX, we chose to give up control of 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{PF}$
\end_inset

 in order to eliminate a possible systematic effect.
 Direct grounding of the foil is no longer required.
 Future pendulum designs and future iterations of this experiment must minimize
 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{PF}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Paragraph
Temperature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The PlateWash apparatus is sensitive to temperature.
 The fiber's equilibrium position and drift rate are perhaps most temperature
 dependent, but there are uncountably many temperature sensitive elements
 in the apparatus.
 To limit the effects of temperature variation, the instrument is located
 in a temperature controlled room.
 The room temperature varies by less than XXX through the year and XXX every
 day.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As passive isolation, the vacuum system is an excellent insulator, with
 a time constant of about a week XXX for the internal aluminum baseplate
 with respect to the outside world.
 As further, rather limited, insulation, the clean room fans are turned
 off during measurement periods, trapping a volume of air around the apparatus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Instrumental noise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many electronic effects can create excess noise.
 Most pick-up effects are indistinguishable from autocollimator noise.
 Because PlateWash normally operates in electrostatic feedback, there is
 a second channel through which EMF pickup, ground loops, and finite digital-to-
analog conversion noise can couple to the pendulum.
 These effects may be assessed by comparing the pendulum noise with and
 without the feedback electrodes grounded.

Systematics

\begin_layout Standard
Systematic uncertainties are the primary challenge of this measurement.
 Ensuring that no gravitational signals are mimiced nor masked demands great
 care.
 For this section, estimates are made of a torque difference between an
 attractor-pendulum distance of closest approach (XXX um) and a point XXX
 um away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Electrical/Instrumental Crosstalk
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any effect that is not directly related to attractor motion, but is aware
 of attractor position, lands in this catchall category.
 In general, these systematics are very important in many experiments.
 In this case, the experiment includes an isolation valve on the air pressure
 line to the attractor bellows.
 The valve is positioned downstream of the electronic pressure gauge.
 The valve may be closed, and 
\bar under
every 
\bar default
electrical signal associated with the operation of the experiment is unchanged.
 The data analysis system is also unchanged, making it possible to test
 for these systematics directly.
 This ability is greatest strength of the pneumatic drive system; any electrical
ly-actuated drive cannot separate electrical crosstalk in this way.
\end_layout

Foil displacement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any attractor-correlated displacement of the isolating foil is a cause for
 concern.
 The pendulum interacts electrostatically with the foil with a coupling
 of ~XXX N-m/um.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Dust
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any dust between the attractor and foil will cause the foil to move once
 the attractor-foil separation is smaller than the dust's characteristic
 size (Pendulum-foil dust is assessed via the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

bounce test
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 Effort has been made to keep the active surfaces very clean, with class
 XXX clean room procedures.
 We see the effects of dust in perhaps 50% of our initial cleanings of a

 The presence of dust is inferred with the interferometer.

Attractor-foil contact potential
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The attractor and foil will, in general, have different values of electrical

 The electrical connections between them will include a collection of Galvanic-p
otential generating junctions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Residual gas pressure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The foil's stiffness is XXX.
 The diffusion time out of the attractor-foil gap is XXX.
 As we wait XXX seconds between moving the attractor and taking data, any
 remaining pressure gradient should be, at most, comparable to the ambient
 pressure itself.
 XXX torr acting on XXX area yields a foil displacement of XXX and related
 torque of XXX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Modulation of ambient foil motion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The foil is in constant motion, especially in its resonant modes.
 The foil has a 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 of thousands or more.
 If those vibration amplitudes change with attractor position, a false signal
 may emerge in the pendulum.
 The ambient modes can be damped by proximity-enhanced gas damping XXX or
 some electrical effect (XXX RC or eddy currents?).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
XXX studied this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Attractor vibration coupling via gas or electromagnetic effects to foil
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the interferometer, we can see that the attractor, at the end of its
 spindles, vibrates with 60 Hz and its harmonics considerably more than
 the foil alone.
 The attractor must also have its own seismically driven vibrational modes.
 XXX we must place a limit on this from on-line ifo traces.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Attractor Drift

\begin_layout Paragraph
Interferometer Opto-coupling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Foil motion inherently changes the ambient light leaving the vicinity of
 the interferometer tip.
 Varying stray light incident on optically sensitive elements of the autocollima
tor could lead to a spurious foil-correlated signal in the autocollimator.

\begin_layout Standard
In the search for non-Newtonian effects, it is essential to understand the
 effects of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 gravity that stem from imperfections in the experiment's design and execution.
 Some of these effects are essential, such as the necessarily finite size
 of the attractor.
 Other effects have been made small by careful design and construction,
 but residual effects must be quantified.

Non-infinite
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 attractor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the attractor does not have the spatial extent of an infinite sheet,
 the gravitational field of the attractor has both distance and misalignment
 dependence.
 To estimate the size of this effect, two independent quadrature programs
 were written.
 When completed, it was discovered that one trivial bug separated the two
 codes from nearly exact agreement.
 See XXX for a description of both methods.
 As expected from flat surfaces in the near field, the torque vs.
 distance curves are predominantly linear.
 For a properly centered pendulum, the expected torque is XXX N-m/m.
 The quadratic term is XXX N-m/m^2.
 There is a left-right asymmetry of the curve due to the asymmetry of the
 pendulum, but for a displacement of the pendulum XXX horizontally and XXX
 vertically, the linear term becomes XXX N-m/m and the quadratic term XXX
 N-m/m^2.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Voids/defects in materials
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Small non-uniformities in density of the attractor or pendulum materials
 can mimic or mask a signal.
 The flat plate geometry of the experiment renders this effect largely second
 order.
 In the absence of an attractor non-uniformity, a pendulum void should be
 expected to have no effect at all.
 In the absence of a pendulum non-uniformity, an attractor void will cause
 a lateral position-dependent torque.
 If the attractor void were to occur near the outer corner of the pendulum
 (worst case), the torque would be XXX N-m/ (cubic micron of attractor).
 In the event that two voids are laterally coincident, the maximum torque
 difference would be XXX N-m/(cubic micron of void).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Horizontal displacement of the pendulum is an excellent test for the local
 effects.
 The largest voids observed in the surfaces under a microscope are about
 XXX in size.
 Note that a distribution of voids across the surface can, with sufficiently
 many voids, be viewed as a reduction in the density of the material.
 This is especially true if the voids are smaller than a characteristic
 length-scale of interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Attractor mount/flexure/bellows gravity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The motion of the attractor mount, spindles, flexure, and bellows introduces
 a small, largely linear, torque background.
 The linear background is expected to be XXX Nm/m.
 The spindles contribute the dominant nonlinear term, which is expected
 to be < XXX N-m/m^2 (or N-m/m^3).

Weight of drive gas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The flow of gas into the attractor drive bellows changes the mass distribution
 near the pendulum.
 XXX cm^3 of gas at 50 psi has a mass of XXX kg.
 The expected torque on the pendulum due to the appearance of XXX kg XXX
 m from the pendulum is XXX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Glue gaps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dense inlays of the attractor and the dense material of the attractor
 face are attached with a thin layer of epoxy.
 It is possible that an air bubble may have become laterally very large
 when the glue layer was pressed.
 Assuming a 1 cm diameter by 1 micron thick glue bubble in both the pendulum
 and attractor, the associated torque is <XXX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Spindle screw voids
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The attractor's aluminum body is attached to aluminum spindles using aluminum
 set screws.
 The screws are matched in length and mass to better than XXX um and XXX
 g.
 The screws and spindles are installed such that the mass distribution is
 most mirror-symmetric about the vertical plane perpendicular to the attractor
 face and coincident with the torsion fiber.
 The set screws were screwed all the way into the attractor, then the spindles
 were screwed onto the screws.
 The remaining voids in the attractor and spindle housings are expected
 to give rise to torques of XXX N-m/m and nonlinearities of XXX N-m/m^2.

Surface flatness

 rms flatness.
 The surfaces were

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by the lapping process, which dominates the rms flatness.
 After a spatial lowpass at XXX scale, the rms roughness of the surfaces
 was XXX um (attractor) and XXX um (pendulum).
 In addition, the pendulum materials' differing hardnesses led to a step
 at the dense/light interface of XXX um.
 A plot of all the surfaces is shown in Fig XXX.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The torque due to the flatness variations of attractor and pendulum was

 elsewhere.
 XXX How the F do we do this reliably?

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Tilt/apparatus deformation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tilt sensitivity is a general affliction of torsion balances.
 Perhaps because of eccentricity of fine torsion fibers, all balances exhibit
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tilt feedthrough
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In short range interaction experiments, the tilt feedthrough is exacerbated
 by the importance of spatially varying electrostatic potentials.
 The apparatus has a two-axis tilt sensor, but it was intentionally turned
 off during data taking to minimize any electromagnetic interference.
 The pendulum autocollimator is sensitive along both vertical and horizontal
 axes, and provides a continuous measurement of pendulum tilt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Nonlinear tilt feedthrough
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The apparatus may have attractor-related tilt for a number of reasons, including
 the displacement of the center of mass of the attractor assembly, deformations
 of the attractor mount, and changing geometry of the attractor air line.
 The flexure was mounted from its center in order to minimize any deformation
 of the apparatus as a whole.
 The deflection is expected to be both small and primarily linear, limiting
 the impact on the measurement.
 We initially estimated the effect of tilt by considering only center of
 mass motion, finding ~XXX N-m
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Flexure non-linearity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One interesting systematic effect that can exhibit considerable nonlinearity
 is the nonlinearity of the flexure itself.
 Most tilt-related effects are essentially blind to the attractor-foil distance.
 In order to maximise our use of the flexure's limited (<2mm) travel, the
 flexure's internal travel limit was located not far from the point at which
 the attractor pressed hard into the foil.
 If the double-compensating mechanism of the flexure experiences nonlinear
 stress near the (artificially-placed with mechanical stops) end of its
 travel, nonlinear stresses might be communicated to the baseplate.
 XXX not sure how to estimate this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Magnetism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Magnetic systematics are among the most difficult to assess in these experiments.
 The foil provides limited, if any, shielding against low frequency magnetic
 fields.
 Because of the considerable strength of the magnetic interaction, great
 care must be taken to ensure that magnetic effects do not mimic or mask
 a gravitational signal.
 For the shortest-range effects, the torsion balance may be the most sensitive
 probe for their existence, complicating things considerably.
 Short range gravity research is becoming increasingly sophisticated in
 this realm; previous tests have only considered some of these effects.

\begin_layout Standard
If impurities are sufficiently numerous, then their presence will only appear

\begin_layout Standard
The magnetic permeability of the attractor and pendulum materials will affect

XXX! The experiment was initially aligned using the autocollimator.
 The attractor was fixed in place against two registry blocks and firmly
 clamped.
 The autocollimator was then centered on the attractor and aligned such
 that the light returned to near the center of the sensor.
 The up-down and left-right angles were recorded.
 The attractor was then translated through its full range of motion, and
 the position on the autocollimator recorded.
 The attractor was adjusted to a point ~20

\end_inset

m from the desired working position.
 The foil and attractor were cleaned with dry nitrogen and with clean room
 wipes/isopropanol.
 The foil was then placed in front of the attractor and iteratively aligned
 to the attractor using a combination of the autocollimator readout and
 a measurement of the attractor-foil capacitance.
 Gross alignment was done by hand.
 Fine adjustment was done using the Belleville washers on the foil mount.
 When optical alignment reached XXX 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$

rad, a capacitance of ~3-400 pF was achieved, and the capacitance seemed
 to be at a minimum as a function of attractor-foil angle, the system was
 declared to be aligned.

\begin_layout Subsection
Cleaning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the attractor and foil were aligned, it was essential to remove any
 debris/dust in the gap between them.
 To characterize the amount of dust in the gap, and to verify alignment,
 the attractor-foil capacitance was measured as a function of attractor
 position, including positions where the attractor touched the foil.
 Touching was, at this step, determined by noting the position where the
 capacitance reading became unreliable.
 The maximum capacitance recorded without signs of touching gave a proxy
 for the minimum attractor-foil separation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The attractor assembly was removed and the attractor face cleaned with isopropan
ol, clean room wipes, and dry nitrogen.
 The same was done with the attractor side of the foil.
 Both attractor and foil were visually inspected for dust.
 The attractor assembly was replaced against the registry blocks and re-clamped.
 The attractor-foil capacitance was measured as a function of attractor
 position.
 The cleaning procedure was repeated until no gains in capacitance were
 observed with subsequent cleanings.
 Typical maximum capacitances were ~2

The critical distances between and relative orientations of the pendulum,
 foil, and attractor were determined with the bell jar closed, under vacuum,

 A number of methods were explored, but the method of choice was as follows:
 The freely twisting pendulum was allowed to tap the foil as the attractor
 was pressed into the foil by the flexure stage.
 As the attractor displaced the foil, the angular amplitude of the tapping
 signal necessarily decreased to zero.
 The point where this occurred was used as a reference to determine the
 absolute distance between the pendulum and the attractor (XXX we should
 repeat at another phitop position?).
 The pendulum twist at this point was taken to be the angle at which the
 pendulum was parallel to the attractor (XXX what about

 (
\begin_inset Formula $10\mbox{ switches}\times256\mbox{ second attractor period}\times3\mbox{ cuts}\div0.8\mbox{ seconds/sample}$
\end_inset

).
 The filters are designed by the octave-forge function 'fir1'.
 The torsion balance feedback signal is sent through a filter whose parameters
 are described in fir1 syntax as [0.001,0.0045,0.005,0.009,0.010,0.05].
 This corresponds to a bandpass filter from

Torque Calibration

\begin_layout Standard
While the torque scale is ultimately hardcoded with the value set in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, the analysis routine is capable of calibrating each data set independently.
 The analysis routine is designed to fit and subtract both the 1-
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 and 2-
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 signals from the attractor.
 The fitting algorithm implements a binary search in frequency for the maximum
 fit amplitude present in the data.
 At present, there is no cycle-mark on the calibration attractor, so no
 attempt is made to match the phase of the fit with an external phase reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To remove transients before fitting, torque data are passed through a 'spikeRemo
ver', applied to the data's time derivative.
 As the calibration signal is continuous, transient signals are interpreted
 as spurious.
 Any 100 s region of data centered on a suspected spike is excised completely.
 Spike detection uses a an aggressive version of Chauvenet's criterion XXX
 (ref).
 XXX (Peirce's criteron may actually be better for this?) The implementation
 loops 20 iterations of the spike removing code to ensure that spikes of
 multiple scales (or spikes sufficiently numerous to pull the initial standard

A clear method of visualization is important to understanding the output
 of any experiment.
 For PlateWash, the natural plot is three-dimensional.
 The experiment measures the difference in pendulum torque between two different
 attractor positions.
 So, if we plot 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau(\mbox{start},\mbox{end})$
\end_inset

, we can plot every measurement in the experiment in a single plot, as in
 Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "TriangleScatterPlot"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three dimensional plots are difficult to read, three dimensional plots with
 errorbars are worse.
 Furthermore, the scatter in a plot like Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "TriangleScatterPlot"

\end_inset

 is dominated by the noisiest points.
 As shown in XXX (plot of noise vs.
 time), the noise in PlateWash varies by orders of magnitude with environmental
 conditions; we're interested mostly in the points with least scatter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to present the result in a meaningful and two-dimensional way,
 the 'triangle plot' was developed.
 In order to improve the statistics by a factor of two, we make the assumption
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau(a,b)=\Delta\tau(b,a)$
\end_inset

, and fold the points over the 
\begin_inset Formula $a=b$
\end_inset

 axis.
 In order to plot points with uncertainties, measurements are plotted as
 circles in the 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b$
\end_inset

 plane.
 The magnitude of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

 is represented by the radius of the circle.
 To provide an errorbar, the region from 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau+\sigma_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau-\sigma_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 is plotted in grey.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau-\sigma_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $|\Delta\tau+\sigma_{\tau}|$
\end_inset

 are greater than zero (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 a point is off-zero with 1-
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 significance), the remainder of the circle is filled in with color.
 To represent the sign of the datapoint, yellow is negative, and blue is
 positive XXX (check sign).
 Any force of nature should satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau(a,a)=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 Any conservative force should be associative: 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau(a,c)=\Delta\tau(a,b)+\Delta\tau(b,c)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This method has limitations.
 Large signals, or large uncertainties produce large circles, which can
 hide smaller, more significant, points.
 For sparsely sampled data, however, it can be very helpful.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Bootstrap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis presented here makes extensive use of a statistical method
 called 'the bootstrap' or 'bootstrapping'.
 Its primary merit in this context is that it allows straightforward and
 reasonably robust estimation of confidence intervals.
 Its support rests upon the premise that the best estimator for the distribution
 from which a data set is drawn is the data set itself.
 The idea is to 'resample' the data to create synthetic data sets which
 may be passed through any analysis routine developed for the original data
 set.
 With repetition, this process generates distributions of important output
 quantities (best-fit points in 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha-\lambda$
\end_inset

 space, for example) without recourse to complex error estimation/propagation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resampling scheme used in this analysis was to replace a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $1/e$
\end_inset

 of the data points in a data set with others randomly selected from the
 initial data set.
 There is a related class of methods called 'the jackknife' that generate
 statistics by considering complete sets of subsets of data.

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to extracting model parameters from the data, we can reconstruct
 the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(d)$
\end_inset

, the pendulum torque as a function of attractor/pendulum separation.
 The entire data set consists of differential measurements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(d)$
\end_inset

, where the attractor measures a 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau=\tau(d_{1})-\tau(d_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 Recovering 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(d)$
\end_inset

 is then similar to recovering a function using knowledge of its derivative.
 Just as in indefinite integration, there is a

\begin_layout Standard
The method used to recover 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(d)$
\end_inset

 is simple - attempt to find a best-fit function which minimizes the difference
 between the measured torques 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau_{meas}$
\end_inset

 and those computed using the fitting function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau_{fit}$
\end_inset

.
 To provide confidence intervals on the fit parameters, we bootstrap the
 measured data many times; the distribution of the extracted fit parameters
 provides the necessary foundation.

In order to generate results that are independent of any physics-model,

\begin_layout Section
Blindness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most accurate experiments are free of bias.
 It is possible to perform an unbiased experiment without a blind, but it
 is difficult to guarantee that all pre-concieved notions of experimental
 results and implications are suppressed.
 Critics of blind experiments claim that, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no experiment is truly blind,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in reference to the current reality that experimenters unblind their results
 prior to peer review and submission for publication.
 This is true, but it hides the power of the blind -- forcing complete and
 equal attention to each 
\emph on
known
\emph default
 systematic effect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PlateWash is not a blind experiment.
 It is a precursor to a blind experiment.
 More than half of the science data were taken without a blind, largely
 because we had not discovered a way to monitor the health of the experiment
 without access to data which included the central values of each measurement.
 In the latter half of science data-taking, it became clear that watching
 the errorbars on each cut XXX(terminology?) was sufficient to ensure data
 quality.
 In this first iteration of PlateWash, our understanding of the instrument's
 metrology was in continuous refinement, which frustrated any attempt to
 inject a fake signal into the data as they were acquired.
 (Furthermore, the physical separation between pendulum and attractor DAQ
 systems would make doing so extremely difficult).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis proceeded as if it were blind, to demonstrate the suitability
 of the analysis toolchain for a future blind analysis.
