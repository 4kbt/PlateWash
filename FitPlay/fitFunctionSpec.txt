A fitting function should have the following properties:

function [values partials dataNames fitNames] = function( data, dataNames, fitParams, fitNames)

end 


* Data should be specified as a column 
* Fit parameters should be specified as a row vector.
* names is a cell array of {"name1" "name2" ...} that specify contents of each column of "data"
* partials returns the partial derivative of f with respect to each data column

**** Acceptable dataNames ***
"position (m)"
"magnetic field (T)"
