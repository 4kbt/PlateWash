=======

This repository contains the analysis code needed to generate the PlateWash data analysis and Charlie's thesis.

To use this code: grab it, get the data from Charlie, then find and replace every instance of '~/goldStandard/' in fixed paths _anywhere_ in the code. This should then execute on any linux box running octave, make, bash, and gnuplot. To compile the thesis, once it's integrated, you'll need LyX. 


Presently functional: 
6/11/13: Calibration routine works. To execute, enter the calibration directory and `make all`.
